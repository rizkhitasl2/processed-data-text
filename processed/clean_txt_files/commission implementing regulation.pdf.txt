COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION EU 2018 2067 of 19 December 2018 on the verification of data and on the accreditation of verifiers pursuant to Directive 2003 87 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council Text with EEA relevance THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Directive 2003 87 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96 61 EC 1 , and in particular the third paragraph of Article 15 and the second paragraph of Article 10a thereof, Whereas 1 This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency to take account of the First Edition of the Internat ional Standards and Recommended Practices on Environmental Protection Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation CORSIA Annex 16, Volume IV to the Chicago Convention adopted by the ICAO Council at the tenth meeting of its 214th session on 27 June 2018, that are intended to apply from 2019. 2 An overall framework of rules for the accreditation of verifiers is necessary to ensure that the verification of operator s or aircraft operator s reports in the framework of the Union s greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system, to be submitted in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation EU 2018 2066 2 , is carried out by verifiers that possess the technical competence to perform the entrusted task in an independent and impartial manner and in conformity with the requirements and principles set out in this Regulation. 3 Experience in the application of Commission Regulation EU No 600 2012 3 has shown the need to improve, clarify and simplify the accreditation and verification rules to further promote harmonisation and enhance the efficiency of the system. A number of amendments therefore need to be made to Regulation EU No 600 2012. In the interests of clarity, that Regulation should be replaced. 4 Directive 2006 123 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 4 establishes a general framework to facilitate the free movement of services and service providers in the Union while maintaining a high quality of service. Union harmonisation of the rules for accreditation and verification relating to the Union s emissions trading system should contribute to a competitive market for verifiers while ensuring transparency and information for operators and aircraft operators. 5 When implementing Article 15 of Directive 2003 87 EC, it is necessary to ensure a synergy between the compre hensive framework for accreditation established by Regulation EC No 765 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 and related provisions of Decision No 768 2008 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 on one hand, and the specific features of the Union s greenhouse gas emission trading system and requirements that are essential for the effective implementation of Directive 2003 87 EC on the other hand. Regulation EC No 765 2008 should continue to apply to those aspects of accreditation of verifiers which are not dealt with by this Regulation. In particular, it should be ensured that where, due to the internal practices of 31.12.2018 L 334 94 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32. 2 Commission Implementing Regulation EU 2018 2066 of 19 December 2018 on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003 87 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Regulation EU No 601 2012 see page 1 of this Official Journal . 3 Commission Regulation EU No 600 2012 of 21 June 2012 on the verification of greenhouse gas emission reports and tonne kilometre reports and the accreditation of verifiers pursuant to Directive 2003 87 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council OJ L 181, 12.7.2012, p. 1 . 4 Directive 2006 123 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market OJ L 376, 27.12.2006, p. 36 . 5 Regulation EC No 765 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accredita tion and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing Regulation EEC No 339 93 OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30 . 6 Decision No 768 2008 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products, and repealing Council Decision 93 465 EEC OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 82 .  a Member State, an alternative procedure to accreditation, namely, the certification of verifiers that are natural persons, is carried out by a national authority appointed by that Member State in accordance with Regulation EC No 765 2008, the Member State concerned shall provide documentary evidence that such authority meets a level of credibility similar to national accreditation bodies that have successfully undergone peer evaluation organised by the body recognised under Article 14 of that Regulation. 6 Regulation EC No 1221 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 provides for an independent and neutral accreditation or licensing system for environmental verifiers. For reasons of coherence and to reduce the administrative burden imposed on the Member States and economic operators, it is appropriate to take account of synergies between that and this Regulation. 7 The system of verification and accreditation should avoid any unnecessary duplication of procedures and organ isations established pursuant to other Union legal instruments that would result in an increased burden for Member States or economic operators. Therefore, it is appropriate to draw on best practices resulting from the application of harmonised standards adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation on the basis of a request made by the Commission in accordance with Regulation EU No 1025 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council 2 , such as the harmonised standard concerning general requirements for accredita tion bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies, and the harmonised standard concerning requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, as well as Document EA 6 03 and other technical documents developed by the European cooperation for accreditation or by other bodies. 8 When establishing harmonised rules for the verification of operator s or aircraft operator s reports and the accred itation of verifiers, it is necessary to ensure that the burden imposed on operators emitting a lower amount of carbon dioxide CO2 per year, on aircraft operators considered small emitters within the meaning of Implementing Regulation EU 2018 2066, as well as on the available resources of the Member States is not disproportionate to the aims pursued. 9 To make best use of synergies and given the importance of verification of data used for the update of ex ante benchmarks and the determination of free allocation to installations, it is appropriate to include rules for verification of baseline data reports and new entrant data reports which are required by Commission Delegated Regulation of 19 December 2018 determining transitional Union wide rules for harmonised free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to Article 10a of Directive 2003 87 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 3 into the harmonised rules for verification and accreditation of verifiers. 10 Article 27 of Directive 2003 87 EC allows Member States to exclude small installations, subject to equivalent measures, from the Union s greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system provided that the conditions contained in that Article are met. Article 27a of Directive 2003 87 EC allows Member States to exclude installation emitting less than 2 500 tonnes, from the Union s greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system provided that the conditions contained in that Article are met. This Regulation should not apply directly to those installations excluded pursuant to Article 27 or 27a of Directive 2003 87 EC unless the Member State decides that this Regulation should apply. 11 In accordance with the principles of Annex V to Directive 2003 87 EC, the verifier should carry out a site visit to check the boundaries of the respective installation or aircraft operator, to assess the operation of measuring devices and monitoring systems, to conduct interviews and to carry out other activities. The verifier s site visit should be waived only under specific conditions. 12 In accordance with the principles of Annex V to Directive 2003 87 EC, the verifier should apply a risk based approach with the aim of reaching a verification opinion providing reasonable assurance that the total emissions or tonne kilometres are not materially misstated and the report can be verified as satisfactory. The level of assurance should relate to the depth and detail of verification activities carried out during the verification and the 31.12.2018 L 334 95 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 Regulation EC No 1221 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco management and audit scheme EMAS , repealing Regulation EC No 761 2001 and Commission Decisions 2001 681 EC and 2006 193 EC OJ L 342, 22.12.2009, p. 1 . 2 Regulation EU No 1025 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation, amending Council Directives 89 686 EEC and 93 15 EEC and Directives 94 9 EC, 94 25 EC, 95 16 EC, 97 23 EC, 98 34 EC, 2004 22 EC, 2007 23 EC, 2009 23 EC and 2009 105 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87 95 EEC and Decision No 1673 2006 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council OJ L 316, 14.11.2012, p. 12 . 3 Not yet published in the Official Journal.  wording of the verification opinion statement. If the findings and information obtained during the verification process so require, the verifier should be obliged to adjust one or more activities in the verification process to meet the requirements for achieving reasonable assurance. 13 To avoid entanglement between the role of the competent authority and the verifier, the responsibilities of a verifier when carrying out verification should be clearly defined. The verifier should take the monitoring plan approved by the competent authority as a reference point and assess whether this plan and the procedures described in this plan have been implemented correctly. Where the verifier identifies non compliance with Implementing Regulation EU 2018 2066, it should be the responsibility of the verifier to report this non compliance issue in the verification report. 14 Full understanding of the activities of an operator or an aircraft operator is necessary for the performance of an effective verification of an operator s or aircraft operator s report. A verifier should only perform the requested verification activities after it has ascertained following a preliminary assessment that it is competent to do so. In the pursuit of a high quality level of verification activities, harmonised rules should be developed for a preliminary assessment to determine whether a verifier is competent, independent and impartial to carry out the requested verification activities in accordance with the rules and principles set out in this Regulation. 15 Provision of relevant information between the operator or the aircraft operator and the verifier is essential in all facets of the verification process, in particular in the pre contractual phase, in the performance of a strategic analysis by the verifier and throughout the verification. It is necessary to establish a set of harmonised requirements that should govern this provision of information between the operator or aircraft operator and the verifier at all times. 16 All verification activities in the verification process are interconnected and should be concluded with the issuance of a verification report by the verifier containing a verification statement that is commensurate with the outcome of the verification assessment. Harmonised requirements for the verification reports and the performance of the verification activities should be established to ensure that verification reports and verification activities in the Member States meet the same standards. 17 Analysing the susceptibility of reported data to misstatements that could be material is an essential part of the verification process and determines how the verification activities should be carried out by the verifier. Every element in the verification process shall therefore be strongly linked to the outcome of the analysis of these risks of misstatements. 18 Specific provision should be made for the verification of the report of aircraft operators and that of operators of sites, which are subject to Directive 2009 31 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 . 19 Correct and effective reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by the operator or the aircraft operator is essential for the implementation of Directive 2003 87 EC. To ensure the proper functioning of the monitoring and reporting process, continuous improvement of the operator or aircraft operator s performance should be part of the verification activities performed by the verifier. 20 Verification activities and the issuance of verification reports should only be carried out by verifiers and their personnel that are competent. Verifiers should establish and continuously improve internal processes that ensure that all personnel involved in the verification activities are competent to perform the tasks entrusted to them. The criteria for determining whether a verifier is competent should be the same in all Member States and should be verifiable, objective and transparent. 21 The national accreditation body established pursuant to Regulation EC No 765 2008 should be empowered to accredit and issue an authoritative statement concerning the competence of a verifier to perform the verification activities pursuant to this Regulation, adopt administrative measures and carry out the surveillance of verifiers. 22 Templates and specific file formats to be used by verifiers promote harmonisation between Member States and avoid differences in approaches. Verifiers should use templates or specific file formats developed by the Commission. Where a Member State has developed national templates or file format specifications, these should contain at least the same content as the templates developed by the Commission to ensure harmonised approaches. 31.12.2018 L 334 96 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 Directive 2009 31 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the geological storage of carbon dioxide and amending Council Directive 85 337 EEC, European Parliament and Council Directives 2000 60 EC, 2001 80 EC, 2004 35 EC, 2006 12 EC, 2008 1 EC and Regulation EC No 1013 2006 OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 114 .   23 A Member State that does not consider it economically meaningful or sustainable to establish a national accredit ation body or to carry out accreditation activities should have recourse to the national accreditation body of another Member State. Only national accreditation bodies that have undergone a successful peer evaluation organised by the body recognised under Article 14 of Regulation EC No 765 2008 should be permitted to perform the accreditation activities pursuant to this Regulation. 24 National accreditation bodies that demonstrate conformity with this Regulation and that have already successfully undergone peer evaluation organised by the body recognised under Article 14 of Regulation EU No 765 2008 should be presumed to fulfil the procedural requirements imposed on national accreditation bodies such as requirements on the structure of a national accreditation body, setting up a competence process, setting up the necessary procedures and management system and arrangements to safeguard the confidentiality of information obtained and should be exempted from undergoing a new peer evaluation following the entry into force of this Regulation. In accordance with Directive 2003 4 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 , environ mental information contained in verified operator s or aircraft operator s reports held by the public authorities should be made public to ensure transparency, subject to certain confidentiality requirements. 25 Effective cooperation between national accreditation bodies, or where applicable other national authorities, and competent authorities is essential for the proper functioning of the greenhouse gas emission allowance system and the supervision on the quality of verification. For reasons of transparency, it is necessary to ensure that the national accreditation bodies, or where applicable, other national authorities, and competent authorities establish effective means of information exchange. Information exchanges between competent authorities and between competent authorities and national accreditation bodies or other national authorities should be governed by the strictest guarantees of confidentiality and professional secrecy and be handled in accordance with applicable national and Union law. 26 This Regulation includes improvements to accreditation and verification that partly take into account the First Edition of the International Standards and Recommended Practices on Environmental Protection Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation CORSIA Annex 16, Volume IV to the Chicago Convention adopted by the ICAO Council at the tenth meeting of its 214th session on 27 June 2018. The Regulation on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003 87 EC is also being amended to take account of the First Edition of the International Standards and Recommended Practices, and these two instruments are being complemented by a Delegated Act pursuant to Article 28c of Directive 2003 87 EC. 27 The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Subject matter This Regulation lays down provisions for the verification of reports submitted pursuant to Directive 2003 87 EC and for the accreditation and supervision of verifiers.

It shall represent faithfully that, which it either purports to represent or may reasonably be expected to represent. The process of verifying operator s or aircraft operator s report shall be an effective and reliable tool in support of quality assurance and quality control procedures, providing information upon which an operator or aircraft operator can act to improve performance in monitoring and reporting emissions or data relevant for free allocation. Article 7 General obligations of the verifier 1. The verifier shall carry out the verification and the activities required by this Chapter with the aim of providing a verification report that concludes with reasonable assurance that the operator s or aircraft operator s report is free from material misstatements. 2. The verifier shall plan and perform the verification with an attitude of professional scepticism, recognising that circumstances may exist that cause the information in the operator s or aircraft operator s report to contain material misstatements. 3. The verifier must carry out verification in the public interest, and be independent of the operator or aircraft operator and the competent authorities responsible for Directive 2003 87 EC. 4. During the verification, the verifier shall assess whether a the operator s or aircraft operator s report is complete and meets the requirements laid down in Annex X to Implementing Regulation EU 2018 2066 or in Annex IV to Delegated Regulation EU , as appropriate b the operator or aircraft operator has acted in compliance with the requirements of the greenhouse gas emissions permit and the monitoring plan approved by the competent authority, where the verification of an operator s emission report is concerned, and with the requirements of the monitoring plan approved by the competent authority, where the verification of an aircraft operator s emission or tonne kilometre report is concerned c where the verification of an operator s baseline data report or new entrant data report is concerned, the operator has acted in conformance with the requirements of the monitoring methodology plan pursuant to Article 8 of Delegated Regulation EU approved by the competent authority d the data in the operator s or aircraft operator s report are free from material misstatements e information can be provided in support of the operator s or aircraft operator s data flow activities, control system and associated procedures to improve the performance of their monitoring and reporting. By way of derogation from point c , the verifier shall assess whether the operator s monitoring methodology plan is in compliance with the requirements of Delegated Regulation EU where the monitoring methodology plan is not subject to approval of the competent authority prior to submission of the baseline data report. If the verifier discovers that a monitoring methodology plan does not comply with Delegated Regulation EU , the operator shall modify the monitoring methodology plan so that it complies with that Regulation. For the purpose of point d of this paragraph, the verifier shall obtain clear and objective evidence from the operator or aircraft operator to support the reported aggregated emissions, tonne kilometres or data relevant for free allocation taking into account all other information provided in the operator s or aircraft operator s report. 5. If the verifier discovers that an operator or an aircraft operator is not complying with Implementing Regulation EU 2018 2066 or with Delegated Regulation EU , that irregularity shall be included in the verification report even if the monitoring plan or monitoring methodology plan concerned, as appropriate, has been approved by the competent authority. 31.12.2018 L 334 100 Official Journal of the European Union EN  6. If the monitoring plan has not been approved by the competent authority pursuant to Article 12 of Implementing Regulation EU 2018 2066, is incomplete or if significant modifications referred to in Article 15 3 or 4 of that Implementing Regulation have been made during the reporting period which have not been accordingly approved by the competent authority, the verifier shall advise the operator or aircraft operator to obtain the necessary approval from the competent authority. If the monitoring methodology plan is subject to the approval of the competent authority prior to submission of the baseline data report pursuant to Article 8 4 of Delegated Regulation EU and the monitoring methodology plan has not been approved or is incomplete, or where significant modifications referred to in Article 9 5 of that Regulation have been made which have not been approved by the competent authority, the verifier shall advise the operator to obtain the necessary approval from the competent authority. Following the approval by the competent authority, the verifier shall continue, repeat or adapt the verification activities accordingly. If the approval has not been obtained before the issue of the verification report, the verifier shall report this in the verification report. Article 8 Pre contractual obligations 1. Before accepting a verification engagement, a verifier shall obtain a proper understanding of the operator or aircraft operator and assess whether it can undertake the verification. For this purpose the verifier shall at least a evaluate the risks involved to undertake the verification of the operator s or aircraft operator s report in accordance with this Regulation b undertake a review of the information supplied by the operator or aircraft operator to determine the scope of the verification c assess whether the engagement falls within the scope of its accreditation d assess whether it has the competence, personnel and resources required to select a verification team capable of dealing with the complexity of the installation or the aircraft operator s activities and fleet as well as whether it is capable of successfully completing the verification activities within the timeframe required e assess whether it is capable of ensuring that the potential verification team at its disposal holds all the competence, and persons required to carry out verification activities for that specific operator or aircraft operator f determine, for each verification engagement requested, the time allocation needed to properly carry out the verification. 2. The operator or aircraft operator shall provide the verifier with all relevant information that enables the verifier to carry out the activities referred to in paragraph 1. Article 9 Time allocation 1. When determining the time allocation for a verification engagement referred to in Article 8 1 f , the verifier shall at least take into account a the complexity of the installation or the aircraft operator s activities and fleet b the level of information and the complexity of the monitoring plan approved by the competent authority or the monitoring methodology plan, as appropriate c the required materiality level d the complexity and completeness of the data flow activities and the control system of the operator or aircraft operator e the location of information and data related to greenhouse gas emissions, tonne kilometre data or data relevant for free allocation. 2. The verifier shall ensure that the verification contract provides for the possibility for time to be charged in addition to the time agreed in the contract, where such additional time is found to be needed for the strategic analysis, risk analysis or other verification activities. The situations where the additional time may be needed shall include at least the following a during the verification where the data flow activities, control activities or logistics of the operator or aircraft operator seem to be more complex than initially anticipated 31.12.2018 L 334 101 Official Journal of the European Union EN   b where misstatements, non conformities, insufficient data or errors in the data sets are identified by the verifier during the verification. 3.
