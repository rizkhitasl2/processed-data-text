The 392.4 million Industry Growth Program the IGP will provide targeted funding to support small to medium enterprises SMEs and startups to commercialise their ideas and grow their operations. The agile and industry led approach of the IGP will support businesses in their most challenging development phase. Continuing investment of 39.6 million in the Single Business Service will improve the effectiveness of government services and investment by ensuring businesses benefit from the suite of government initiatives. These programs complement other initiatives that are scaling up and transforming priority sectors, including manufacturing, transport, logistics and trade. Initiatives include the   Portfolio Budget Statements Page 16 Department of Industry, Science and Resources Cooperative Research Centres Program, manufacturing sector grants, the National Rail Manufacturing Plan, and the Country of Origin Food Labelling program. The government is also investing in high quality advice on emerging industries, like space, through sustainable funding of the Australian Space Agency, including its regulatory functions. Collectively, these efforts will transform Australian industry by aligning investment across government priorities, helping businesses become more resilient and more capable of developing, commercialising and adopting cutting edge technologies. The government is investing 101.2 million in quantum and artificial intelligence AI to accelerate critical technologies industries to increase local capacity and capability. This will support advanced manufacturing and increase the number of well paying jobs in Australia in sectors that are crucial to national security and geostrategic interests. It also supports the coordinated growth of these sectors and enables the adoption of critical technologies in safe, responsible ways. The potential benefits of commercialising critical technologies are significant. AI technologies alone will be worth an approximate 22 trillion AUD to the global economy by 2030. Early and directed investment in our advanced technology industries helps guarantee Australia s research, intellectual property and companies remain onshore, supporting the government s goal of 1.2 million technology related jobs by 2030. The National Quantum Strategy outlines the importance of programs incentivising the uptake of quantum technologies and supporting industry coordination, to grow this industry in Australia. Industry growth and technological advancements must be led by scientific capacity and capability. The government is supporting expert digital and STEM policy advice and coordination through the National Science and Technology Council. It will also ensure significant science outreach activities like the Prime Minister s Prizes for Science continue to build and secure Australia s STEM talent pipeline for the future. The government is investing in the sustainability of Questacon as part of its commitment to preserve and elevate Australia s national scientific capabilities.

Investment will ensure Questacon can continue providing access to underserved communities, including national travelling programs for regional and remote areas. Support for the National Measurement Institute will ensure it can continue to deliver essential services that underpin safety assurance and economic development. These services range from export compliance with international standards, to illicit drug analysis and profiling services, to chemical and microbiological analysis of food and agricultural products ensuring conformance to health standards.  Portfolio Budget Statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Page 17 The government will ensure Australia s policy and regulatory settings enable industry, including the resources sector, to contribute to the global transition to net zero. These settings will help industry capitalise on the opportunities of a low emissions economy, while reducing their own emissions. The government s commitment to reach net zero by 2050 requires leadership on technology and skills development and industry buy in to drive the manufacture of renewable technologies. The 14.8 million Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre PAIGC will provide advanced technology and skills development to businesses looking to locally manufacture renewable energy technologies. The PAIGC will support job opportunities and greater wealth for the nation by upskilling Australian businesses to manufacture, commercialise and adopt renewable technologies. The National Battery Strategy will further support industry s transition to renewable energy. Batteries are crucial to Australia s economic prosperity, supply chain security and renewable energy future. The strategy will support Australia s intent to have a sustainable, thriving, end to end battery industry. The PAIGC and the National Battery Strategy are both components of the Australian Made Battery Plan and will complement the NRF. These measures are complemented by the department s broader efforts to support government to identify and manage critical supply chain risks, as well as opportunities and risks emerging from economic transition. The department will continue to support the resources sector to play a vital role in driving Australia s economic growth and productivity. This includes its role of developing innovation, supporting new and emerging technologies, and creating employment opportunities for Australians, particularly in regional areas. The industry already contributes 14.4 per cent to Australia s Gross Domestic Product and employs more than 280,000 people. In 2021 22, Australia s resources sector reached record export earnings of 422 billion, representing 71 per cent of the value of our total exports. Australia is a world leader in the production of critical minerals including lithium spodumene, titanium rutile , zircon, rare earths and cobalt. As such, Australia will benefit from the projected increase in global demand for critical minerals, including the potential for lithium demand to grow 40 times by 2040. The government is focused on unlocking Australia s critical minerals potential, which will be vital to climate change mitigation, national prosperity and global security. The government is investing 23.4 million in continuation of the Critical Minerals Office, building upon existing measures, including the Critical Minerals Development Program and the Australian Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub.   Portfolio Budget Statements Page 18 Department of Industry, Science and Resources The government is investing 57.1 million to secure strategic and commercial international partnerships. This will leverage growing demand and build diverse and resilient critical minerals supply chains. Gas will continue to play an important role in supporting the transformation of Australia s energy system and those of other countries to net zero emissions. Gas provides useful flexibility as countries add more renewables to the grid and assists Australia and its partners to process critical minerals and manufacture the batteries, semiconductors and clean energy technologies that are fundamental to reaching net zero. The government will deliver a Future Gas Strategy, which will support Australia s energy system to reach 82 per cent renewables by 2030 and become cleaner, cheaper and more reliable, while maintaining our international reputation as a trusted energy supplier to our longstanding trading partners. The Australian Government will partner with the Queensland Government to fund research and development projects and technology trials to reduce emissions in Australia s energy resources sector and enhance energy security. This initiative complements the commercial methane abatement measure introduced in the October 2022 23 Budget. A productive resources sector relies on the government s support for responsible and sustainable stewardship and a strong social license to operate throughout the full lifecycle of each industry. The department will develop a roadmap for establishing a decommissioning industry in Australia. This roadmap will position Australia to harness the estimated 60 billion of offshore petroleum decommissioning activities expected to occur over the next 30 to 50 years. The department will undertake a review of the environmental management regime for offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities to ensure it is fit for purpose for a decarbonising economy. This will include consultation requirements for offshore projects, including with First Nations Australians. The review will also examine opportunities to provide regulatory and administrative certainty for offshore carbon capture and storage projects to enable Australian industry to meet net zero targets whilst delivering domestic energy security and regional energy security. The department continues to deliver on the government s commitment to decommissioning the Northern Endeavour while ensuring ongoing safety and environmental protection. Continued investment in the safe and secure long term management and disposal of Australia s radioactive waste supports responsible stewardship and maintains confidence from our international partners and the Australian community. The government will  Portfolio Budget Statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Page 19 provide ongoing resourcing for the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency ARWA and invest 171.9 million to develop a plan for the disposal of Low and Intermediate Level Waste, and set a responsible and sustainable approach for the long term management and disposal of Australia s radioactive waste from temporary storage sites around Australia. ARWA will also provide expert advice to support Australia s Nuclear Powered Submarine Program.

Portfolio Budget Statements Page 26 Department of Industry, Science and Resources Section 2 Outcomes and planned performance Government outcomes are the intended results, impacts or consequences of actions by the government on the Australian community. Commonwealth programs are the primary vehicle by which government entities achieve the intended results of their outcome statements. Entities are required to identify the programs which contribute to government outcomes over the Budget and forward years. Each outcome is described below together with its related programs. The following provides detailed information on expenses for each outcome and program, further broken down by funding source. Note Performance reporting requirements in the Portfolio Budget Statements are part of the Commonwealth performance framework established by the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. It is anticipated that the performance measure described in Portfolio Budget Statements will be read with broader information provided in an entity s corporate plans and annual performance statements included in annual reports to provide a complete picture of an entity s planned and actual performance. The most recent corporate plan for the Department of Industry, Science and Resources can be found at The most recent annual performance statement can be found at It is for the former Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. Some functions of the former department were transferred to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water and therefore no longer form part of the Department of Industry, Science and Resources planned performance.

The organisation s primary functions are set out in the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987. ANSTO is Australia s national nuclear research and development organisation, and the centre of Australian nuclear expertise. ANSTO operates a large proportion of Australia s landmark research infrastructure, including the Open Pool Lightwater OPAL multipurpose reactor, the Australian Synchrotron, the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering, and the Centre for Accelerator Science. Thousands of researchers from across Australia and around the world partner with ANSTO to tackle complex problems that improve human health, save lives, build sovereign capability for Australian industries and protect the environment. To ensure OPAL s continued safe and reliable operation and to maximise utilisation, ANSTO undertakes regular scheduled maintenance and upgrades. From mid March 2024 to early July 2025 OPAL will be shutdown to replace the reactor s unique cold neutron source CNS . The CNS has an operational life of 15 years, replacing it offers increased scientific research performance. ANSTO has an essential role in nuclear medicine manufacturing in Australia. On average ANSTO s radioisotopes are used in 10,000 12,000 nuclear medicine procedures each week that benefit Australians battling cancer and other diseases. ANSTO s daily operations are critical to the health and wellbeing of the nation. ANSTO is taking steps to upgrade its nuclear medicine manufacturing facilities. This will reduce the risk of unplanned supply disruptions and promote positive health outcomes for Australians, especially in regional areas.   Portfolio Budget Statements Page 72 Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ANSTO will contribute to the government s new Nuclear Powered Submarine Program by providing expert advice and augmenting Australia s stewardship capabilities and credentials. In addition, ANSTO will continue to prioritise activities and research to support Australia s response to the unprecedented challenges the country is facing including ANSTO scientists and its collaborators utilising our unique infrastructure, such as the Australian Synchrotron to better understand the structure of viruses, including COVID 19 which, in turn, assists in the development of vaccines and treatments. Understanding the world s environmental problems focusing on managing and sustaining Australia s water resources, climate change including contributions to Australia s critical Antarctic research program , and the impact of contaminants. Through testing at ANSTO s Centre for Accelerator Science, ANSTO is supporting an industry led initiative to identify and phase out PFAS chemicals which are very resistant to environmental degradation in food packaging. Building capacity to respond to environmental change including past climate variability, ocean circulation, the global carbon cycle, landscape evolution and degradation, and other human impacts. Conducting research into Australian bushfires to assist with planning, mitigation, and response to extreme bushfire events. Prioritising water research and partnering with communities to provide a scientific basis for managing and sustaining Australia s precious groundwater resources. ANSTO s Australian Synchrotron continues its partner funded 98 million BR GHT beamline expansion program, with eight new beamlines being constructed. This will nearly double the Synchrotron s capacity and allow for broader engagement with researchers and industry in a range of applications, from high tech manufacturing, including aerospace and transport, to health, including drug development and medical implants.

Its purpose is to be the trusted advisor on Earth sciences to inform government, community and industry decision making. This contributes to a strong economy, resilient society and sustainable environment. During the Budget and forward years, Geoscience Australia will implement and progress Australian Government priorities and key Budget measures. Through the Positioning Australia program, Geoscience Australia is implementing a national system for open, reliable and high accuracy positioning across Australia. A national network of ground stations and a Satellite Based Augmentation System will deliver positioning data accurate to 10 cm across Australia, and 3 to 5 cm in areas of mobile phone coverage. The 4 year 2020 2024 , 124.5 million Exploring for the Future phase two program will continue to deliver high quality data and information that improves the understanding of the nation s resource potential. This is driving the next generation of mineral, energy, and groundwater discoveries in Australia that will underpin Australia s path to net zero, attract investment, generate jobs and secure the resources we need into the future. Geoscience Australia will continue to deliver the 30.9 million Data Driven Discoveries initiative. Geoscience Australia is collating and applying modern analysis techniques to reprocess old geoscientific information and data and will be collecting new geoscientific data to deepen our knowledge of a key underexplored area of south west Queensland. The program will help discover potential for hydrogen storage, critical minerals, and carbon capture and storage, stimulating new investments in the region. Geoscience Australia has partnered with the Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics to establish the Australian Climate Service. Funding announced in May 2021 of 209.7 million over 4 years to establish the Australian Climate Service is supporting better connection and leveraging of the government s extensive data, information and capabilities to inform climate and disaster risk management.   Portfolio Budget Statements Page 128 Geoscience Australia In the 2021 22 Budget, Geoscience Australia received 40.2 million over 4 years to develop a Digital Atlas of Australia. The Digital Atlas of Australia will be a free, interactive geospatial map that will provide valuable data on Australia s population, economy, employment, infrastructure, health, land and the environment. This will support governments, businesses and the community to make more informed decisions about planning, infrastructure and investment at the local and national level. Through the Digital Earth Australia program, Geoscience Australia will continue to provide free and open satellite land imaging data and derived information products to support Australian governments to make better decisions on policy, investment, management and operations, and Australian industry and business to create new capabilities that increase efficiency, productivity and employment opportunities across the Australian economy. As part of the Australian Government s National Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub, funding of 9.4 million over 4 years 2022 23 to 2025 26 was allocated to Geoscience Australia to undertake research on Australia s future critical minerals needs and supply. The Hub brings together Australia s world leading research capabilities of Geoscience Australia, CSIRO, and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. Geoscience Australia will achieve its impacts with a focus on science excellence, optimising its data, fostering collaboration and strong partnerships, and providing a more diverse and inclusive workplace.

This is mainly due to an 11.1 million decrease in appropriation revenue from the Australian Government, mainly comprised of Exploring for the Future phase two decrease of 24.2 million Satellite Based Augmentation System net decrease of 22.7 million Digital Atlas of Australia decrease of 2.4 million Strategic Basin Plans increase of 0.6 million Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub increase of 2.4 million Savings from External Labour, and Savings from Advertising, Travel and Legal Expenses increase of 8.0 million Economic parameter adjustments including indexation and foreign exchanges rates The budgeted deficit for 2023 24 is 12.8 million. The deficit represents depreciation and amortisation of 10.3 million, which is not funded under the Government s net cash appropriation arrangements, and depreciation and amortisation on right of use assets of 27.7 million, less principal payments on leased assets of 25.2 million. Budgeted Departmental Balance Sheet Geoscience Australia s budgeted total assets of 495.2 million and total liabilities of 367.4 million in 2023 24 represent an decrease of 66.3 million and 74.5 million respectively from 2022 23. This reflects an expected decrease in appropriations receivable and supplier payables associated with recent measures and net decrease of our asset base.  Portfolio Budget Statements Geoscience Australia Page 137 Budgeted Capital Budget Statement Planned capital expenditure for Geoscience Australia in 2023 24 is 21.1 million. This comprises capital expenditure funded from equity injections of 13.1 million and the departmental capital budget of 8.0 million.

Portfolio Budget Statements National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Page 201 Section 2 Outcomes and planned performance Government outcomes are the intended results, impacts or consequences of actions by the Government on the Australian community. Commonwealth programs are the primary vehicle by which government entities achieve the intended results of their outcome statements. Entities are required to identify the programs which contribute to government outcomes over the Budget and forward years. Each outcome is described below together with its related programs. The following provides detailed information on expenses for each outcome and program, further broken down by funding source. Note Performance reporting requirements in the Portfolio Budget Statements are part of the Commonwealth performance framework established by the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. It is anticipated that the performance criteria described in Portfolio Budget Statements will be read with broader information provided in an entity s corporate plans and annual performance statements included in annual reports to provide a complete picture of an entity s planned and actual performance. Once operational, the accountable authority of NRFC will develop a corporate plan and annual report within the required timeframes.   Portfolio Budget Statements Page 202 National Reconstruction Fund Corporation 2.1 Budgeted expenses and performance for Outcome 1 Outcome 1 To facilitate increased flows of finance into priority areas of the Australian economy, through targeted investments to diversify and transform Australian industry, create secure, well paying jobs, and boost sovereign capability Linked Programs Once operational, the accountable authority of NRFC will develop performance measures that will be included in the initial 2023 24 NRFC Corporate Plan. The linked programs for Outcome 1 will be published in the 2024 25 Portfolio Budget Statements.

Portfolio Budget Statements National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Page 205 Section 3 Budgeted financial statements Section 3 presents budgeted financial statements which provide a comprehensive snapshot of entity finances for the 2023 24 Budget year, including the impact of budget measures and resourcing on financial statements. 3.1 Budgeted financial statements 3.1.1 Differences between entity resourcing and financial statements There are no material differences between the entity resourcing table and the financial statements. 3.1.2 Explanatory notes and analysis of budgeted financial statements The National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Act 2023 received Royal Assent on 11 April 2023 and will commence on a date to be set by proclamation. Following commencement of the Act, the entity will become financially independent upon the formation of the Board of the Corporation. In accordance with the Act, the independent Board is to decide the strategies and policies to be followed by the Corporation giving consideration to the investment mandate and the priority areas declaration and is to ensure the proper, efficient and effective performance of the Corporation s functions. The budgeted financial statements represent indicative estimates available in advance of the formation of the Board. These estimates do not bind the Board, with the Board to make its own independent assessment and allocation of resources upon establishment. Not for publication nfp amounts in 2023 24 Budget measures as shown in Table 1.2 are excluded from the budgeted financial statements. Budgeted Departmental Income Statement The revenue from Government estimate for 2023 24 is 39.0 million. The revenue from external sources estimate for 2023 24 is 6.8 million. An operating loss of 2.2 million is forecast in 2023 24 reflecting the accounting treatment of concessional loans. Budgeted Departmental Balance Sheet Total financial assets are estimated to be 547.9 million in 2023 24, largely comprising loans and advances of 325.2 million and cash and cash equivalents of 196.0 million. Total non financial assets are estimated to be 14.2 million in 2023 24. Contributed equity is estimated to be 564.2 million in 2023 24. This largely reflects a drawdown of 550 million from the NRFC Special Account in that year.
