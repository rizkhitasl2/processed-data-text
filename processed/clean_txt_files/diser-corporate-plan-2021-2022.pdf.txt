Data To ensure we have the best evidence available to inform our work, we are improving employees data fluency, optimising data governance and management processes, embedding best practice analytics and increasing the use of location data. This will further drive robust, evidence based policy design tailored to the specific and diverse circumstances and needs of all Australians. Our new Data Strategy 2021 2024 focuses on 4 priority areas including Capabilities and Culture providing continuous training opportunities to help employees analyse, visualise, use and share data, and empowering leaders to foster a data driven culture. Governance enhancing our data management and governance processes and technology across the data lifecycle, and making more data accessible and discoverable. Analytics expanding self service analytics and visualisation offerings, and supporting deployment of new analytic platforms. Location based insights raising awareness of the value of location data, and supporting improved location data analysis and digital mapping. Finance We are committed to best practice financial management, providing the certainty and stability that is essential to the department s endeavours. A key focus for 2021 22 is to continue the delivery of the Financial Management Strategy, and further strengthen our financial management capability. Key elements of the Strategy include increasing financial literacy and proficiency, and anticipating the capabilities needed in a rapidly changing landscape of policy, program and service delivery. The financial capability uplift takes an enterprise view, equipping staff with the required skills and knowledge to make informed financial decisions. This uplift will be supported by initiatives that build a strong culture of financial management and continuous improvement. Through our professional and engaged workforce, we will enhance our finance and business expertise, improve client service delivery through a risk based approach and build on our strong financial management culture to help achieve portfolio objectives. Governance We have strong governance in place to preserve and strengthen stakeholder confidence, to deliver on our purposes and strategic priorities, and to support compliance with our legislative, regulatory, financial and other obligations. In line with best practice, our governance committee arrangements have been refined to achieve strategic oversight, goal clarity, and greater accountability, including better articulation of our risk appetite and policy framework and better decision making operations. Our governance committee structure provides assurance and oversight of our management responsibilities and accountabilities across our organisation, delegations framework, information and records management, internal audit, risk management and business planning. Our governance committee structure includes the Executive Board and its sub committees, which assist the Secretary in decision making and discharging his oversight and governance obligations. These forums cover people and culture, financial management, program performance assurance, performance reporting, risk oversight and management, and security.  Corporate Plan 2021 22 17 Enterprise strategic and operational risks DISER is unable to maintain the conﬁdence and trust of government, industry and the public. Strategic DISER fails to deliver on Government priorities and implementation of programs. DISER fails to be inﬂuential, including with its complex and extensive stakeholder networks. DISER is unable to attract, develop and retain the people capability it needs. Operational DISER fails to protect its information and information systems. DISER fails to maintain a work environment that is safe and promotes wellbeing. DISER fails to maintain good governance and ethical standards and adhere to its legal obligations. DISER is unable to maintain ﬁnancial sustainability. Figure 4 The department s enterprise strategic and operational risks. Risk The department has a diverse range of responsibilities as policy adviser, program administrator, and regulator, and faces a range of risks reflecting these responsibilities. It is not possible to eliminate all risks inherent in our work. Risk management is a central part of the department s culture, embedded in our policies and processes, providing practical tools and techniques upon which to make balanced and informed decisions in dynamic circumstances. Our enterprise strategic and enterprise operational risks are those that, if realised, would materially affect our ability to achieve our vision and purposes. The department has revised its Risk Management Framework RMF , incorporating the new enterprise strategic and enterprise operational risks and clarity on tolerances through a new risk appetite statement. Risk structure, support, communication and training initiatives have been identified as focal areas to uplift the department s risk maturity. The RMF also addresses expectations of the department s management of shared risks, to ensure clear documentation and appropriate governance mechanisms support appropriate treatment. We continue to promote risk management actively as a mechanism to better manage and implement initiatives and projects, in turn building our risk maturity profile and culture. In conjunction with the revised RMF, improvements include enhanced tools and facilitated training, benchmarked risk culture and the nomination of risk stewards who promote, track and escalate our top level risks.  18 OUR PERFORMANCE This section of the corporate plan sets out our performance information and describes how we intend to measure our success in achieving our purposes.
