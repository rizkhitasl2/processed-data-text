Yours sincerely Meghan Quinn PSM 14 October 2022  3 CHAPTER 1 PORTFOLIO AND DEPARTMENTAL OVERVIEW Secretary s review I am pleased to release the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources Annual Report 2021 22. I acknowledge the way the department supported the previous government s response to several challenges over the year. These included the ongoing impact of COVID 19 and international events that disrupted important supply chains. As we adjust our work to align with the machinery of government changes and support the new government s priorities, we will continue to deliver results for Australia across our portfolio responsibilities. The portfolio s programs represented strong investment in Australia s manufacturing and science capability, new energy technologies and resource development, as well as in emerging technologies in fields like quantum, AI and space. We supported job creation and growth in metropolitan and regional Australia by leveraging our extensive AusIndustry network. We stimulated the deployment of low emissions technology to allow Australia to realise the benefits of new and existing clean energy as we work towards net zero. Our scientific and technical activities strengthened economic prosperity and innovation. Through our international partnerships and collaboration we continued our commitment to leveraging Australia s strengths. We supported growth in Australia s critical minerals sector, taking advantage of our natural resources and building supply chains through strategic partnerships. We collaborated across government to make real changes that improved the lives of Australians. This included supporting Australia s waste management and recycling industries and making sure building access standards were fit for purpose to better meet the needs of people with disability. We continued to promote science engagement through grants, prizes and sponsorships that encourage the broader community to engage with science. This included hybrid delivery of youth focused science events to connect young people through science in the face of COVID 19 restrictions. Professor Eddie Holmes received the 2021 Prime Minister s Prize for Science in recognition of his 30 years of work on viruses, including being the first person to share the COVID 19 virus genome publicly. This raised the profile of Australian scientists at home and overseas.  4 CHAPTER ONE Portfolio and departmental overview Supporting women to thrive in high paying and essential STEM jobs remained as one of our priorities. The Superstars of STEM initiative improved the visibility of women in STEM by providing media training, mentoring and networking. We worked with others to improve Australia s research capability, including with Australia s Chief Scientist Dr Cathy Foley AO PSM and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This positioned the National Science and Technology Council to provide timely and authoritative scientific advice on emerging issues and priorities. To support businesses to invest and create jobs we supported new and developed industries and continued our business outreach. We were on the ground immediately following the floods that affected northern New South Wales and south east Queensland at the beginning of 2022, working with other agencies to provide customised support to affected businesses. High priority was given to strengthening Australia s supply chain resilience this year. We worked with industry to address vulnerabilities in supply chains for critical products. These included medicines, agricultural production chemicals, personal protective equipment PPE , semiconductors, water treatment chemicals and telecommunication equipment. This year we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Research and Development Tax Incentive R DTI program. The program was the Australian Government s main mechanism to stimulate Australian industry investment in research and development R D . It has supported well over 30,000 companies in its lifetime, attracting between 2,000 and 3,000 businesses to register for the first time each year. We continue to work towards the goal of Australia becoming a major producer and exporter of clean hydrogen by 2030. With over 90 hydrogen projects announced around the country, Australia has a world leading pipeline of clean hydrogen projects, positioning it to be a major global hydrogen exporter. The National Measurement Institute NMI continued to deliver essential measurement standards and services that underpin business continuity, sovereign capability and international trade. This included consultation on the measurement frameworks needed for hydrogen vehicle refuelling and electric vehicle recharging systems in preparation for hydrogen and electric vehicle uptake. To build long term productivity, growth and sustainability, we engaged across sectors to secure our supply chains and support sustainability projects and clean technology. This included microgrid solutions to address the unique power supply challenges in regional and remote communities.  5 CHAPTER ONE Portfolio and departmental overview In June 2022, the Australian Government submitted its updated Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement. This included a new emissions reduction target of achieving 43 below 2005 levels by 2030. The Powering Australia plan gives a roadmap to decarbonise each sector. We have begun implementing the plan s suite of new measures across the economy to meet the 2030 target and drive the transition to net zero. Over the year, we expanded the number of countries we were working with to address climate change and were pleased to join our Quad partners the United States, Japan and India to cooperate on advancing a clean hydrogen partnership and clean energy supply chains in the Indo Pacific region. Our people are integral to our ability to deliver for the Australian community. In the past year, we continued to adapt to a post COVID environment with an increased focus on wellbeing and a hybrid work environment that reached beyond capital cities diversity and helping all staff to feel confident and comfortable bringing their whole selves to work We completed our Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan RAP and look forward to launching our Stretch RAP program in 2022 23. Our first Indigenous affirmative measures recruitment process was a great success, resulting in 28 job placements across the department. We will use a similar approach in 2022 23 to build an affirmative measures process for people with a disability. The achievements in my review represent a sample of accomplishments of this portfolio over the past 12 months, and I encourage you to explore the highlights section in Chapter 2. The full report gives an overview of our contribution to economic and productivity growth and job creation for all Australians. The relationships built across our industry, science, resources, climate change and energy functions place us in good stead to work towards transitioning the Australian economy to net zero by 2050. I am confident that we will continue to serve the Australian community with the same professionalism and commitment in 2022 23.  6 CHAPTER ONE Portfolio and departmental overview Portfolio overview Ministers Figure 1 Responsible Ministers The Hon Chris Bowen MP Minister for Climate Change and Energy The Hon Madeleine King Minister for Resources and North Australia The Hon Ed Husic MP Minister for Industry and Science Senator the Hon Jenny McAllister Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy Senator the Hon Tim Ayres Assistant Minister for Manufacturing and Assistant Minister for Trade A new government was sworn in on 23 May 2022 following the 2022 federal election and on 23 June 2022, the Governor General, acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council, made an Administrative Arrangements Order to commence on 1 July 2022.

Meghan Quinn PSM Secretary 14 October 2022  14 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Our role How we supported economic growth and job creation for all Australians. Throughout 2021 22, we sought to maximise what we delivered on behalf of the Australian Government for Australians. We took actions to leverage and build on Australia s strengths support businesses to invest and create jobs drive long term productivity, growth and sustainability. Our report on performance includes a highlights section to showcase the breadth of our work and how we delivered tangible outcomes for Australians over the year the Annual Performance Statements 2021 22, through which we report our progress towards the purposes set out in the Corporate Plan 2021 22 and Portfolio Budget Statements 2021 2022. To assist the reader, a description of the structure of the performance statements and how they relate to the Corporate Plan 2021 22 and Portfolio Budget Statements 2021 2022 is included with the Annual Performance Statements. Highlights We are proud of what we achieved over 2021 22. The following gives a sample of our highlights for the year. Leveraging and building on Australia s strengths We worked to pursue economic prosperity, promote Australia s development of clean energy technologies, lead the way with AI and engage Australians from all walks of life in science. Through international partnerships and collaboration, we remained dedicated to making the most of Australia s strengths. Transforming Australian manufacturing Over the year we helped businesses scale up and commercialise new projects, create jobs and compete in global markets. Manufacturers showed they were keen to invest, with every dollar in grants funding leveraging around 1.89 in private sector investment.  15 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Case studies Supporting Australian manufacturers to innovate and compete, meet their manufacturing challenges and grow. Davidson Engineering The Davidsons invented a farm fencing clip in a shed in rural Victoria. When their clips caught the attention of domestic and international customers on social media during the pandemic, their second hand manufacturing equipment struggled to meet demand. Matching a 100,000 manufacturing grant, the couple went into business as Davidson Engineering, buying new equipment to scale up production. The grant and ongoing support and advice from their AusIndustry regional manager helped them increase their sales to 2 million clips in 2020 21. They expect to triple this in 2022 23. Since 2018, Davidson Engineering s staff has grown from 4 to 7. The couple plan to employ up to 4 more people as the business continues to expand in both domestic and international markets. CQ Field Mining Services A full metal fabrication workshop based in Mackay, Queensland, CQ Field Mining Services had outgrown its facilities and was unable to meet growing domestic demand. It received a 1 million manufacturing grant to fit out the facility with modern equipment. The grant also helped upskill its workforce to take advantage of increased market opportunity and onshore maintenance work. With guidance and support from AusIndustry s Central Queensland Regional Manager, the business is now identifying new technology and improvements to business processes for continued growth. CQ Field Mining Services employs 350 people and will increase its workshop staff from 10 to 30 once the fit out is complete. This is bringing more work into the Mackay region and helping the business grow domestically and internationally. Australian Distilling Co. Perth based distiller James Young started out making craft gins and vodka as a solo operator in a small 36 m2 shed in 2016. After receiving a 100,000 manufacturing grant and working with AusIndustry facilitators and his local regional manager, James upgraded and expanded the production facility. This included installing a new still and bottling line. Australian Distilling Co. now employs 27 full time staff. The business has grown more than 100 a year, expanded its range of Old Young s and Gingin Gin brands and has increased production with a second distillery.  16 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Critical minerals Australia is rich in critical minerals. We supported this growth sector building strategic partnerships including a memorandum of understanding with the Republic of Korea on cooperation in critical mineral supply chains for minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite the Australia India Critical Minerals Investment Partnership to support collaboration to identify opportunities for strategic investment in Australian critical minerals projects. Advancing AI and quantum leaps Australia punches above its weight in technology and science, as illustrated in AI. We support the development and adoption of secure, trusted and responsible AI to maintain Australia s globally competitive position in existing and emerging industries. The National Artificial Intelligence Centre within CSIRO s Data61 runs Australia s efforts to develop and adopt AI attract investment and worldleading specialists to supplement the existing deep and specialised AI workforce in Australia. We developed Australia s Artificial Intelligence Ethics Framework, to ensure AI is safe, secure and responsible. Australia is also collaborating as a founding member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence. International engagement with our partners on quantum technologies is central to continuing to support and accelerate the growth of Australia s quantum industry. We formalised a Joint Cooperation Statement on Quantum Information Science Technologies with the United States. We built relationships with quantum stakeholders in the United Kingdom and Japan. We also began looking for opportunities to further grow Australia s quantum industry. Out of this world The Australian Space Agency worked with Geoscience Australia, CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Department of Defence, to lead Australia s inaugural national space program. This program will see Australia design, build and operate satellites for the first time. This work will carve out an important role for Australia internationally, with the satellites set to capture globally unique data.  17 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Continuous development to improve Australian lives We worked with more than 15 agencies to lead a whole of government response to the parliamentary inquiry report From Rubbish to Resources Building a Circular Economy. The response, tabled on 17 February 2022, recognised the significant efforts underway to support Australia s waste management and recycling industries. We reviewed the Disability Access to Premises Buildings Standards 2010. The review was carried out to make sure the standards are current and support people with disability to fulfil their potential as equal members of inclusive and accessible communities. We also ensured that the standards were fit for purpose to help building certifiers, developers and managers fulfil their responsibilities to people with disability under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. The updated standards improve accessibility regulations, help people understand their rights and responsibilities, and increase consistency between Premises Standards and other disability standards. Case study Building sovereign health capability Each week the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ANSTO delivers around 12,500 doses of radioisotopes to over 250 hospitals and health care clinics across the country. These medicines are used in the diagnosis of cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and musculoskeletal conditions as well as lung and heart imaging and the treatment of some cancers. On average, all Australians will undergo a nuclear medicine procedure during their lives, ranging from imaging scans to treatment. However increasingly, Australia s locally made nuclear medicines are at risk because of outdated manufacturing infrastructure. Nuclear medicines have a short shelf life and cannot be reliably imported. To secure Australia s long term sovereign capability, we worked with ANSTO to develop an initial business case for a new nuclear medicine production facility. The Australian Government subsequently committed 30 million for Phase 1 of the project design and planning . We expect the new nuclear medicine production facility will take around 8 years to commission. Through it, Australia will have ongoing sovereign capability in nuclear medicine manufacturing. ANSTO will be able to continue its research into new diagnostic and therapeutic agents to treat conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular disease and by working with Industry innovations in personalised medicine can be translated into improved patient outcomes. ANTSO will support nearly 1,000 highly skilled jobs across the nuclear medicine sector, including in service delivery and manufacturing. Our continued involvement in the nuclear medicine production facility will support Australia s sovereign health system and help Australia remain at the forefront of scientific research. This will support development and commercialisation of breakthrough technology, and create new opportunities for a highly skilled domestic workforce.  18 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Women in STEM Supporting women to participate or re skill and thrive in high paying and essential jobs in the STEM sector and growing the pool of future women STEM leaders remained a priority. Through the Boosting the Next Generation of Women in STEM program, 42.4 million has been committed over 7 years to provide up to 500 university scholarships in partnership with industry. The first round of scholarships will be announced early in the 2022 23 financial year. We also secured an additional 6.7 million to extend successful gender equity initiatives, including the Superstars of STEM program delivered by Science and Technology Australia. This will continue to improve the visibility of women in STEM and provide media training, mentoring and networking for national cohorts of STEM professionals. Case study Growing the evidence base for gender equity, diversity and inclusion solutions that achieve systemic change There is a long way to go when it comes to embedding genuine and sustainable gender equity, diversity and inclusion across the Australian tertiary education and research sector. In recognition of this, we fund the Science in Australia Gender Equity SAGE program. An important element to monitoring change is to grow the evidence base through data collection. In April 2022, SAGE hosted its first virtual international conference Diversity Interventions 2022 SAGE Systemic approaches that work . With more than 230 participants from Australia, UK, India and the USA and 68 speakers across 43 sessions academics, advocates and policymakers came together. Discussion topics included evidence based programs that reduce gender inequity in universities and other workplaces. We supported a practice focused presentation for the Australian Institute of Marine Science and a session led by Women in STEM Ambassador Professor Lisa Harvey Smith and her office on the National Evaluation Guide for STEM Gender Equity Programs. We also raised awareness of our STEM Equity Monitor a national data report on girls and women in STEM. The monitor reports the current state of STEM gender equity in Australia, and measures changes and trends. Engaging Australians in science We continued to promote science engagement through grants, prizes and sponsorships that encourage the broader community to engage with science. Professor Eddie Holmes received the 2021 Prime Minister s Prize for Science. The award was in recognition of Professor Holmes 30 years of work on viruses. This included being the first person in the world to share the COVID 19 virus genome publicly, raising the profile of Australian scientists at home and overseas. In response to COVID 19 restrictions, we supported the delivery of the National Youth Science Forum as a hybrid event. A record 630 students took part in 12 days of events, lectures and experiments either in person or online. We also held 5 days of in person talks by high profile STEM professionals in Perth where restrictions allowed . The 2022 National Youth Science Forum program included 2 Nobel laureates and several chief scientists. Other activities included workshops with other leading scientists and STEM organisations careers days social events STEM challenges an evening with Dr Karl Kruszelnicki live crosses to research stations in Antarctica, the Natural History Museum in London and CERN in Switzerland.  19 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance We also supported 92 access and equity scholarships for students who would otherwise have found it difficult to attend. Science Meets Parliament 2022 brought together Australian scientists and policymakers for a weeklong virtual professional development event for more than 500 scientists and technologists. It gave participants the opportunity to meet with 60 parliamentarians from all sides of politics and share information on some of the latest scientific breakthroughs. Supporting Australia s research capability Over the year, we worked closely with others to enhance Australia s research capability, both now and into the future. We worked with Australia s Chief Scientist, Dr Cathy Foley AO PSM and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to position the National Science and Technology Council to provide timely scientific advice on emerging issues and priorities. Case studies Helping young Australians engage with STEM STEM skills are foundational to future economic prosperity, productivity and international participation. It is critical that government and industry continue to work together to invest in the future of Australia s STEM skills to shape our future workforce and advances in technology. One of our core missions is to promote STEM skills and interest in science. The following are examples of how we progressed this agenda over 2021 22. Hands on science goes virtual With lockdowns continuing across Australia, Questacon scaled up its digital presence to support student, teacher and family STEM development, particularly for those taking part in at home learning. As part of Distance and Rural Technology DART Learning s Virtual Week in Canberra, Questacon hosted a one hour webinar for schoolchildren across Australia. More than 13,000 participants connected to this webinar. Activities included encouraging budding young aerospace engineers to test and modify various paper plane designs to explore the science of flight. By embracing new technologies during a time of uncertainty, Questacon increased access to STEM activities for families around the country. This continued to build awareness of Australia s STEM capability. Using the lessons learned through COVID 19 lockdowns, Questacon is continuing to reach communities across Australia through hybrid STEM opportunities. This will help all Australians to access STEM education. Engaging rural and remote communities in face to face science When lockdowns lifted, students, teachers and communities were keen to move out from behind the screen and come together in person and find connections through science. The Questacon Science Circus brought STEM experiences to regional, rural and remote communities, overcoming technology barriers to improve access. Questacon and its founding partner, the Australian National University ANU , have been delivering face to face engagement in regional and remote communities through the Science Circus for over 36 years. In this time, Questacon has engaged with more than 2.5 million Australians in over 600 towns and 110 remote First Nations communities. The Science Circus is also a practical component of the ANU Master of Science Communication, which this year welcomed its 500th masters student.  20 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Engineering is elementary Teachers are building Australia s future workforce, but many have reported that they do not have the skills or confidence to teach engineering content in their classrooms. These teachers are keen to build their skills and content knowledge to more effectively teach STEM to their students. Investing in teacher skills means large scale investment in future workforce skills. This year, 285 teachers from 185 schools participated in Engineering is Elementary which was developed by the Museum of Science, Boston USA. The teacher led program s whole of school approach is for teachers both with and without specialised STEM skills. This teacher led program uses engineering design challenges to engage students with a focus on high quality professional learning activities. Post workshop surveys have demonstrated the program s success in improving teachers knowledge, skills and dispositions for teaching engineering in their classrooms. Most participants 90 felt the workshops enhanced their capacity for STEM pedagogy and teaching practices, and 98 of teachers applied the programs in their classroom or school to some extent. Questacon has delivered Engineering is Elementary in Australia in partnership with the Australian Defence Force since 2019. So far, more than 1,000 teachers in over 500 schools from every state and territory have participated in the program. Mathematics is a key foundational skill However, compared with previous decades, fewer Australian students are choosing to study higher level mathematics in secondary school. The Australian Government s Inspiring Australia Science Engagement Programme aims to inspire and engage young Australians in STEM subjects at school and university. This included opportunities to take part in international mathematics competitions. The Australian Maths Trust receives 25,000 in annual funding from the program to mentor and train students for the annual European Girls Mathematical Olympiad EGMO . In the 2022 EGMO, the Australian team of 4 students came third overall out of the 57 countries taking part. Each Australian team member placed in the top 20 contestants. Australia has participated in the EGMO since 2018. This has resulted in expanded programs and more girls choosing to take part in problem solving at the highest levels, with participants acting as role models for their peers. Supporting businesses to invest and create jobs We continued to pave the way for economic growth through business outreach and support of new and developed industries. We gave a variety of disaster relief, tax incentives and grants to support Australian businesses. This facilitated job creation in the clean energy and space sectors. Disaster recovery AusIndustry regional managers were on the ground in the immediate aftermath of the floods that affected northern New South Wales and south east Queensland at the beginning of 2022. They worked with other government agencies to provide integrated and tailored support to affected businesses. This included participating in economic recovery disaster management committees coordinated by local councils, attending business recovery hubs and being involved in NSW Government Flood Roadshow events. In response to natural disasters, AusIndustry s Strengthening Business service matched eligible business owners with a facilitator. This service helped them recover and strengthen their business systems, operations and strategies into the future. Over 2021 2022, the service continued to give support to eligible businesses across 32 local government areas in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia impacted by the Black Summer bushfires and COVID 19 opened support to eligible businesses across 30 local government areas in New South Wales and Queensland impacted by the 2022 floods.  21 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance We continued to assist businesses with the ongoing impact of COVID 19. With expanded hours during peak outbreaks, we took around 110,000 COVID 19 related phone calls, emails, webchats and chatbot contacts from businesses needing help and advice. We connected them to appropriate support across all levels of government. Business outreach and engagement AusIndustry continued to engage and support Australian businesses by connecting them to relevant support and services across all levels of government, including through business.gov.au, which logged 8.76 million digital interactions, with 70 of business owners preferring to access their business information online, saving them time and money the business contact centre, which engaged with nearly 200,000 customers, with 85 satisfied or highly satisfied with the service the AusIndustry Outreach Network, which engaged with over 5,000 businesses, giving referrals and guidance on relevant support programs and services for their business. We also shared valuable business and regional intelligence. AusIndustry supported 2,996 unique businesses through 3,309 grants awarded in 2021 22. These grants were delivered across 58 different programs, with a total grant value of 1.1 billion. This funding created jobs and drove improved capability through workforce upskilling, scaling up production, and supporting Australian businesses to expand into export markets. Our new online Employment Contract Tool helps small business employers make an employment contract that complies with workplace laws. Since its launch in June 2021, it has been used by small businesses and first time employers to streamline the creation of more than 35,000 contracts. This has saved businesses an estimated 1.9 million by reducing their regulatory burden. Case study Putting the pieces together to help businesses reach their goals Working out how to help a business is a lot like doing a jigsaw puzzle. All the pieces are in front of you, and the challenge is to see how they fit together to create the final image. This is the role of AusIndustry s Outreach Network. It delivers on the ground support for Australian businesses through its network of 27 local regional managers that are located right across the country. Regional managers connect with Aussie businesses and listen to their individual needs. They also help businesses access support across all levels of government, and bring all the pieces together to help them achieve their goals. One such business is Acora on the South Coast of New South Wales. This multigenerational company designs, manufactures and distributes sawmilling machinery and equipment for Australia and New Zealand. Helping to solve their particular puzzle was Illawarra and South Coast Regional Manager Peter Masterson. When Peter first met Acora, he saw the company needed advice and guidance rather than just funding. He referred them to the Australian Government s Entrepreneurs Programme, which helped improve company structure and identify opportunities for efficiencies and growth. From there, Acora accessed the Innovation Connections service to help them investigate how they could improve manufacturing processes by building stronger research relationships. When Peter recognised Acora was ready for the next big step, he suggested they apply for funding through the Modern Manufacturing Strategy. Acora were successful and used this funding to install new systems to automate processes and revolutionise their business. Over a 5 year relationship, AusIndustry helped Acora increase profits and become more productive and competitive. It has also helped the business employ 5 new staff.  22 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Securing our supply chains Bolstering Australia s supply chain resilience was a key whole of government priority this year. We worked with industry to analyse real and potential vulnerabilities in supply chains for critical products, including medicines agricultural production chemicals personal protective equipment PPE semiconductors water treatment chemicals telecommunication equipment. In 2021 22, we awarded 31.1 million to support 26 projects that address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of medicines and agricultural production chemicals. One challenge addressed is spoilage of products because of freight disruptions. For example, Mediport received over 1 million to expand Australia s capabilities for last mile refrigerated pharmaceutical delivery. The company employed over 20 new staff and increased its fleet by 30 including mobile refrigerated Coldtainers and backup generators. Research and Development Tax Incentive We celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Research and Development Tax Incentive R DTI program on 8 September 2021. This program is the Australian Government s main mechanism to stimulate Australian industry investment in research and development R D . It has supported well over 30,000 companies in its lifetime, attracting between 2,000 and 3,000 businesses to register for the first time each year. This year Industry Innovation and Science Australia made its first determination that certain clinical trials meet the requirements for being core R D activities . This gives certainty for companies and streamlines applying to the program. We also released the Software related activities and the Research and Development Tax Incentive, the latest to be published under the AusIndustry Australian Taxation Office joint administration for software related R D activities. Case study Aussie businesses maintain their innovative edge through research and development Bringing innovative ideas to life takes time, money and the right expertise. Maintaining an innovative edge against global competitors takes even more. AusIndustry helps Aussie businesses make it happen through the R DTI. The R DTI is designed to encourage businesses to engage in R D activities by offsetting some of the costs associated with innovation. Founded 18 years ago by 2 geophysicists in a suburban shed in Perth, DUG Technology is a high performance computing company. It competes against multi billion dollar companies through the strength of its R D and has been a regular recipient of the R D Tax Incentive. Founder Dr Matthew Lamont said It has been tremendous for us and has allowed us to do things that we simply wouldn t be otherwise able to do. R D is at the core of who we are and what we do. The R DTI has been important to both our immersion cooling technology and our high frequency imaging with full waveform inversion research. This research has led to some revolutionary breakthroughs in seismic data processing and imaging. Today, DUG Technology has more than 250 staff members across 4 offices. More than a quarter are based in Australia including the 40 member R D team, mathematicians, physicists and programmers who devise algorithms for a growing suite of clients. Their work has resulted in the company s growing portfolio of patent applications, 13 as of 2021. DUG Technology now exports its advanced algorithms globally and operates some of the biggest and greenest supercomputing data centres in the world.  23 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Essential measurement services The National Measurement Institute NMI continued to deliver essential measurement standards and services that underpin business continuity, sovereign capability and international trade. Its activities included ongoing support of responses to COVID 19, including working with the Therapeutic Goods Administration on face masks and the reliability of rapid antigen tests consultation on the measurement frameworks needed to ensure that hydrogen vehicle refuelling and electric vehicle recharging systems will meet regulatory requirements for trade in preparation for hydrogen and electric vehicle uptake providing unique sample analysis services to safeguard acceptance of Australian food and agricultural exports and challenge technical barriers to trade raised by some markets. NMI also continued to work with the Department of Health to enhance the testing capabilities needed to host major sporting events in Australia between now and the 2032 Olympics. Driving long term productivity, growth and sustainability Australia s future is a bright one we are safeguarding future growth by securing our supply chains and supporting sustainability projects. We have also bolstered domestic vaccine manufacturing capability, clean technology and microgrids, securing fuel supplies and supported the massive Square Kilometre Array SKA radio telescope. Decommissioning the Northern Endeavour We made good progress with the decommissioning and disconnection of the Northern Endeavour floating production storage and offtake FPSO facility and associated oil fields in the Timor Sea north of Darwin to remove future potential risks and to protect the environment. Steps have been taken to secure the safety of personnel and protection of the environment. We continued to work with the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority NOPSEMA to provide expertise and advice, and to monitor compliance. We nominated Petrofac to be the registered operator of the facility. This will enable NOPSEMA to regulate occupational health and safety under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Safety Regulations 2009 in the same way as any other operator and safety case. Microgrids and offshore energy production Regional and remote communities face unique challenges to electricity supply, including price and high risk of outages because of extreme weather events and bushfires. Many communities rely on expensive and polluting diesel generation for their primary or backup electricity supply. We supported the development and deployment of microgrid solutions that will improve the reliability, security and affordability of electricity supply for regional and remote communities across Australia, while also reducing emissions. The Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund has supported 38 studies into the feasibility of microgrids for more than 110 communities, including more than 60 remote First Nations communities. The Regional Australia Microgrid Pilots Program, to be delivered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency ARENA over 6 years, has begun its rollout of 50 million to support microgrid pilot projects. The Australian Government is co funding a grant as part of the Daintree Microgrid Program to deliver a renewable energy microgrid incorporating solar, batteries and hydrogen in the World Heritage listed Wet Tropics of Queensland.  24 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre and the National Battery Testing Centre The world economy is pivoting towards renewable energy, and one of the essential components for stable renewable energy is batteries to give consistent power. The Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre FBICRC brings together partners across the battery value chain, from those mining raw materials through to those processing, manufacturing, servicing, and recycling and re using batteries. By investing with its partners in R D and education, the FBICRC is helping tackle energy transition challenges as well as supporting Australian industry capitalise on domestic and international demand for batteries. The FBICRC estimates that a diversified battery industry could contribute over 7 billion annually to Australia s economy and support more than 34,000 jobs by 2030. Access to reliable high quality testing services is essential to the battery supply chain. Currently all testing is conducted overseas. To address this, the National Battery Testing Centre NBTC facility is being set up as part of the Australian Made Battery Precinct. The centre will provide a sovereign battery testing capability. It will also support Australian battery researchers and manufacturers to develop market ready products and build a skilled workforce. This will ensure that Australia is best placed to take advantage of the international movement towards renewable energy. Offshore electricity We achieved a foundational milestone with the start of the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Act 2021. This will help unlock new renewable energy opportunities, such as wind farms, which can now be progressed in Australian waters. Offshore wind farms have the potential to deliver year round affordable clean energy, power local manufacturing industries including green hydrogen and green steel and create regional jobs and investment. Australian climate change expertise on the world stage The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC published its landmark Sixth Assessment Report AR6 on climate science, impacts, and adaptation and mitigation options. Forty Australian experts contributed to this report, which will remain an important resource for policymakers around the world for many years to come. They were selected as AR6 authors and review editors vice chair of the Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability report as a member of the scientific steering committee. We partly funded these experts as well as adding to the IPCC s rigorous assessment review and approval processes. This meant that the significant body of research and literature by Australian scientists was appropriately reflected and that the assessments were more balanced, transparent and relevant to policy. Long term emissions reduction and international partnerships On 16 June 2022, the Australian Government submitted its updated Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement. This included a new emissions reduction target of achieving 43 below 2005 levels by 2030 and reaffirmed the nation s net zero by 2050 target. The Australian Government s Powering Australia plan gives a clear and comprehensive roadmap to decarbonise each sector. We started the plan s suite of new measures across the economy to meet the ambitious 2030 target and drive the transition to net zero. International collaboration and cooperation play a crucial role in tackling climate change. This includes international partnerships to help accelerate clean energy technology development and deployment to reduce emissions and create economic opportunities. Technology is essential to meet the 43 emissions reduction target by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050.  25 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Over the year, we expanded the number of countries we are working with to address climate change to include the United Kingdom, the Republic of Korea and India. These partnerships focus on low emissions technologies, including hydrogen, solar and green steel. They lay the groundwork for the large supply chain projects that will be needed to reshape the international clean energy trade landscape. We were also pleased to join our Quad partners the United States, Japan and India to cooperate on advancing a clean hydrogen partnership and clean energy supply chains in the Indo Pacific region. The Square Kilometre Array SKA radio telescope The SKA is a global science project to build the world s largest and most capable radio telescope and expand our understanding of the universe. It will also drive technological developments worldwide over its 50 year lifetime. In October 2021 we signed the host country agreement between the SKA Observatory and Australia. This sets out the terms by which Australia will host the SKA telescope. We also made significant progress towards an Indigenous land use agreement with the Wajarri Yamaji people to set up the SKA telescope on Wajarri Yamaji land. Fuel storage and domestic refining The Fuel Security Framework brought together fuel security programs and legislation, including the Fuel Security Act 2021 which commenced on 30 June 2021 . The Act establishes the overarching head of power for 2 new fuel security measures the Fuel Security Services Payment and the minimum stockholding obligation. These measures are designed to increase Australia s domestic fuel security. Diesel is vital to fuelling Australia s economy and is one of our biggest sources of energy. It is also used by emergency services and is the backup power source for electricity generation in critical services like hospitals, water and sanitation, and for electricity generation in remote communities. As part of the framework, the Boosting Australia s Diesel Storage Program is investing up to 260 million to expand diesel storage onshore. This will help boost Australia s long term fuel security and resilience to fuel supply disruptions, and create around 1,000 new jobs during construction. We negotiated grant agreements during 2021 22, and 9 projects have started across 5 states and territories. Case study Building energy efficient homes with Your Home Australia s guide to environmentally sustainable homes Your Home is a website and book that gives advice on the best design, materials and appliances to make Australian homes more comfortable and sustainable when building, buying or renovating. It includes technical information, case studies and free downloadable house designs to support Australians to lower their energy use and carbon emissions. It also helps reduce building costs while improving energy efficiency and comfort. We released the sixth edition of Your Home in September 2021. It was produced by the Australian Government with input from industry, academics and scientific editors. The latest edition features new and updated information on low emission technologies, renewable energy systems and batteries, and achieving passive house standards. It also covers condensation and air tightness, building in bushfire prone areas, and designing homes resilient to a changing climate. Your Home is popular, with about 1.4 million page views per year since it was first launched. Over 3,100 copies of the sixth edition of the book have been sold and more than 671,000 people have accessed the updated resource for free online. The update of Your Home was supported by an independent strategic review carried out in 2018 that found unanimous support among stakeholders for the resource. Your Home gives independent advice and a range of benefits to a diverse audience. From homeowners and consumers to industry professionals and education providers, Your Home continues to help build industry skills and consumer awareness to support energy affordability.  26 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Supporting staff to succeed Our people are central to our ability to deliver for the Australian community. In the past year, we continued to adapt to a post COVID environment with an increased focus on wellbeing and a hybrid work environment diversity and helping all staff to feel confident and comfortable bringing their whole selves to work expanding the visibility of our department as an employer of choice. Flexible work and leveraging talent beyond capital cities A secure, modern and reliable ICT environment remains fundamental to how effectively we operate, both for our staff and for Australian businesses. The past year has reinforced work life balance and maximising technology to create work from home environments that are as productive, collaborative and safe as our physical offices. While responding to varied public health orders and changing realities during the pandemic, we remained focused on providing a safe workplace. Even when most of our workforce was working remotely, we stayed connected online and found innovative ways to connect, collaborate and achieve great outcomes. As vaccines rolled out and public health directions changed, we transitioned to hybrid working arrangements. These arrangements balanced individual needs with our commitment to delivering outcomes for government and all Australians. We also developed a deep understanding of how remote and hybrid work arrangements can enable us to tap into the broader pool of talent and experience outside capital cities. We supported our people through a range of professional development programs and applied the lessons learnt as we responded to fast paced, emerging issues. This experience is now used to inform targeted recruitment. Case study Rapid response to complex supply chains challenge informs future crisis response The Diesel Exhaust Fluid DEF Taskforce showed how a small and agile team can be effective when addressing complex and significant challenges. Post crisis, we carried out targeted training sessions, leveraging private sector expertise, to better equip our people to respond to future emergencies. The diesel exhaust fluid AdBlue keeps Australia s supply chains functional. Without this additive, diesel vehicles, such as road trains, are unable to meet emissions standards, pumping pollutants into the atmosphere. Securing supply of AdBlue was critical to avoiding a significant threat to our nation s transport sector and the broader economy. The DEF Taskforce used a multi pronged approach to safeguard the AdBlue supply in Australia and ensure its distribution across the country, working with industry to address complex national supply and distribution issues relevant parts of government, including the Office of Supply Chain Resilience Department of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Building strength and excellence through diversity We are committed to the Reconciliation Action Plan RAP framework as a way of advancing reconciliation. In line with this, we successfully completed our Innovate RAP. Reconciliation Australia has invited us to participate in the Stretch RAP program that will be launched in 2022 23. Through our first Indigenous affirmative measures recruitment process, we provided 28 jobs for First Nations Australians across the department, complementing our apprenticeship and other career starter pathways. Working in close partnership with Aboriginal Employment Strategy, we deployed a process based on forming trust and providing personalised support, empowerment  27 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance and mentoring. This approach emphasised accountability and inclusion. The national recruitment process also helped us build connections across networks and into communities as a top tier employer offering opportunities to start and grow careers across policy and professional roles. The success of this approach prompted its use as a roadmap to build an affirmative measures process for people living with disability. This will be launched in 2022 23. Another important initiative of our Inclusion Strategy 2021 23 and Accessibility Action Plan 2020 25 was the self identification project. Through it, we set out to understand and address any barriers to staff sharing their diversity information. Valuable insights were provided by the 1,564 staff who participated in the survey, which will inform our ongoing inclusion work. Case study Commitment through Indigenous affirmative measures In 2021 22, we placed 28 skilled and experienced First Nations employees in meaningful policy, program and corporate roles across our responsibilities. To do this, we built an end to end process   investing time in establishing trust and personalising support that was characterised by empowerment and mentoring. We also connected with First Nations candidates, organisations and communities to build relationships. Our targeted attraction strategy used relevant channels to raise awareness of opportunities and roles. This included online advertising, radio messaging through First Nations radio stations, and connecting with First Nations businesses. We also used usual advertising channels, such as the departmental and Australian Public Service websites. The screening, selection and placement process was inclusive, accessible and gave wrap around tailored support. Candidates were given detailed and specific information to understand roles on offer, the environment in which those roles sat, and their business requirements. We arranged effective and meaningful opportunities for candidates to showcase their individual capabilities, capacity and interests with confidence. One of the candidates, Helen, said The support was meaningful, fantastic, not just a tick box. The process working with the team was easy, relaxed and I felt like I was talking to an old friend who wanted the best outcome for me . Specialised induction and in role training was delivered to candidates based on assessments of need developed during initial conversations. Training goals and needs were identified and supported for success. The skill, adaptability, and attitudes of the trainers involved were vital components of the success of the training program. Ongoing support for successful candidates was highly differentiated and based on individual strengths and needs. Helen said I was supported to find the best match for my skillset, provided support to understand the team and role. I was in a special group of people who had been proactively sought out authentically for the greater good. I loved it. I felt like I belonged . Building on this success we will be undertaking the affirmative measures process again in 2022 23 and have also commenced a disability affirmative measures process that is occurring across 2023. Breaking the bias We continued to reflect on how to become a more inclusive place to work by recognising and influencing cultural and organisational change. One example of this in action over the year was refocusing the Women s Network to form the Gender Equity Network. The network promotes gender equity through events, networking and mentoring opportunities, supporting career development, and advocating to remove barriers to gender equity. It aims to challenge gender stereotypes and is pursuing gender equity with an intersectional lens.  28 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Staff wellbeing We introduced Injury Assist for our staff. The national 24 hour health service was one of the first early intervention programs in Australia to go live. Its strong and positive uptake by our workforce indicates it is performing an important service for our staff across Australia, whether working in the office or from home. Through the program, staff with a new injury or issue related to work can contact a registered nurse for a consultation before being directed to appointments or treatments to support them in achieving the best wellbeing outcomes. We also launched Cancer Aid, a partnership that provides 2 programs one for staff with first hand experience of cancer, and another for staff who are supporting or caring for someone living with cancer.

We assessed our performance using 9 output measures focused on the quantity and quality of activities 7 efficiency measures focused on obtaining the most benefit from available resources 12 effectiveness measures that assessed our delivery against our purposes. Figure 5 Assessment of performance Performance measures by type Output Efﬁciency Effectiveness Assessment of performance Partially met Met Not met Not able to be reported  31 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance This year 20 of the 28 performance measures were assessed as met 6 measures were assessed as partially met 2 measures were assessed as not able to be reported. The following Annual Performance Statements provide detailed information relating to the outcome for each performance measure. The number of Partially met assessments was materially influenced by the use of composite measures where one or more elements were achieved. The introduction of a Not able to be reported assessment category highlights the need to ensure that targets reflect the status of the activities the measure relates to. Both these lessons have been used to inform the structure of performance measures for 2022 23 and enhance our overall performance management approach. Definitions for the assessment of measures. The following definitions were used to determine the overall assessment of each performance measure Met All elements for this measure were achieved. Partially met The majority of elements of the measure were met, with some limitations. Not met The majority of elements of the measure were not met. Not able to be reported The target set for a measure did not align for the reporting period, and as such we are unable to report a result against the measure.  32 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Annual Performance Statements APS Purpose 1 Science and industry The activities under this purpose are focused on supporting economic growth, productivity and job creation for all Australians by investing in science, technology and commercialisation, and helping innovative and competitive businesses to grow throughout industries and regions.

Met3 Data source Data maintained internally, held by the department The Cooperative Research Centre CRC Program provides grant funding to support industry led collaborative partnerships working on industry identified problems to improve the competitiveness, productivity and sustainability of Australian industries. It is a well regarded and longstanding competitive, merit based program. In 2021 22, the total number of business and research organisations active in CRCs and CRC projects was 1,759. This is consistent with previous years, as we see regular movement of partners during the grant life cycle. The long term average of the number of partners participating in CRCs and CRC projects is expected to remain stable, given the program appropriation is not increasing and the number of CRCs and CRC projects and by extension participating partners are limited by the available funds. 3 While there is a slight reduction compared with 2020 21 results, this measure has been assessed as met because this result is within expectations of the program. A review of the measure has determined that year on year increase was not an appropriate target.  34 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Performance measure 2 Target Result Assessment Application for registration of R D activities through the Research and Development Tax Incentive RDTI are processed within 40 business days for first time registrants 20 business days for registrants that have applied within 6 months after the end of the income period 80 business days for registrations submitted from 6 to 10 months after the end of the income period 95 88 97 100 Partially met Data source Data maintained internally, held by the department The registrations related to this measure are for the 2020 21 financial year as at 30 June 2022. Over this period 2020 21 more than 12,000 companies registered for the R D Tax Incentive program, and registered expenditure was 13.06 billion, up from 12.6 billion in the previous reporting period. Processing times were met for all registrant types for the first 3 quarters of 2021 22. Despite the reallocation of resources to meet the expected registration peak period in the final quarter, timeframes for first time registrants were not met and planning to improve processing during future peak periods is underway. The full year result for first time registrants processed within timeframes was 88 of applicants, below the target of 95 . A main constraint of processing volume is the program focus on supporting first time registrants with guidance and education. This involves a close review of the activities that are being registered and in many instances, tailored engagement with the company. These discussions help the company determine whether the program is the right fit for them and improves future registration applications. RDTI figures are reported for the fiscal year preceding the one just concluded. This allows businesses time to register their activities and claim the RDTI.  35 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Performance measure 3 Target Result Assessment Overall assessment Met Proportion of Australians who consider STEM skills important when considering employment Young Australians 87 Young Australians 92 Met Data source Youth in STEM survey, STEM Influencers Teachers and Career Advisers survey, STEM Influencers Parents survey Performance targets are based on surveys conducted every 2 years.

This trend was evident in the 2021 22 result. Based on data available at the time of reporting, around 3.16 of co investment was leveraged for each dollar invested by the Australian Government in low emissions technologies in 2021 22. This interim result is within the Technology Investment Roadmap target of leveraging between 3 5 of new co investment over the decade to 2030, and an improvement on the result of 2.06 achieved in 2020 21. The combined overall average co investment since 1 July 2020 is 2.46. While this is currently below the decade long target of at least 3 leveraged per dollar of government investment, on the basis of the emergent trend as explained above, this measure has been assessed as met.

Table 11 presents the results as measured against the performance criteria for Purpose 4 and its associated Activity 4.1, as set out in the Corporate Plan 2021 22, page 30 31.  51 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Table 11 Performance measure results for Purpose 4 Activity 4.1 Performance measure 22 Target Result Assessment Australia s security of supply of quality liquid fuels Establish the Fuel Security Framework to administer new and existing fuel legislation by 1 July 2022 The Fuel Security Framework is established to effectively and efficiently administer fuel security activities, including the Fuel Security Service Payment enacted by the Fuel Security Act 2021, with majority of the key measures implemented. Met Data source Information maintained internally, held by the department The Fuel Security Framework brings together the fuel security programs and enabling legislation administered by us, as well as our participation in global efforts to enhance fuel security. This is designed to improve Australia s long term fuel security and ensure a domestic refining capability for our critical fuels. Fuel security programs to enhance Australia s domestic fuel security include boosting Australia s Diesel Storage Program a grant program to increase the amount of domestic diesel storage. In 2021 22, 8 grant agreements covering storage of an additional 653 megalitres of diesel and other products were executed the Refinery Upgrades Program a grant program to support infrastructure upgrades at refineries to bring forward the introduction of better quality fuels from 2027 to 2024. In 2021 22 applications from the 2 major refiners for Phase 1 of the program were approved by the Minister and one agreement was executed. Australia s fuel security legislation includes Fuel Security Act 2021 The Fuel Security Act gives effect to the Fuel Security Services Payment FSSP and the Minimum Stockholding Obligation MSO . The FSSP provides eligible refiners with a payment for the production of transport fuels jet fuel, petrol and diesel when refinery margins are poor, in exchange for commitments to remain operational until at least 2027. The FSSP was implemented in Q2 2021 22. Payments of 12.45 million were made for Q1 2021 22. No payments were made for the remainder of the year, as refinery margins improved. We undertook extensive public and industry consultation on the main policy elements of the industry stockholding obligation in 2021 22, and developed draft legislative rules. Implementation was delayed as part of Australia s contribution to International Energy Agency IEA actions to support global oil supplies. Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 The Fuel Quality Standards Review Cost Benefit Analysis was completed and a Regulation Impact Statement is being prepared. Liquid Fuel Emergency Act 1984 Consultation work has progressed during 2021 22 on modernisation of the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act 1984 and updated legislation is expected to be introduced to Parliament in 2022 23. Petroleum and Other Fuels Reporting Act 2017 The launch of new data reporting and analytical tools for the monthly Australian Petroleum Statistics, which improve market transparency on Australia s liquid fuel supply and use, government priorities energy data australian petroleum statistics Australia has committed to return to compliance with the International Energy Agency IEA 90 day oil stockholding obligation by 2026. In 2021 22, Australia released stocks held in the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve US SPR in support of an IEA collective action to release oil stocks into the global market, in response to the impact of the invasion of Ukraine on global energy markets. Australia also contributed to the second IEA collective action in April 2022 through delaying implementation of its stockholding obligation.  52 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Performance measure 23 Target Result Assessment Lower energy prices Overall assessment Partially met Progress towards wholesale price 70 per MWh in the National Electricity Market Progress towards wholesale price 70 per MWh in the National Electricity Market NEM 116.15 MWh Not met Data source The Australian Energy Market Operator AEMO The average NEM wide wholesale electricity price for 2021 22 was 116.15 MWh. As a result of increased levels of low cost renewable energy, particularly rooftop solar combined with lower operational demand, average NEM wide wholesale electricity prices remained below 70 for the first half of 2021 22. However, average NEM wide results for the second half of 2021 22 exceeded the  70  MWh benchmark. Wholesale energy prices are influenced by external factors beyond the Australian Government s control. International energy markets have experienced significant volatility and sustained high prices throughout the first half of 2022, driven by global pandemic recovery, changing energy market dynamics and the war in Ukraine. During 2021 22, the NEM experienced very high prices being driven by higher demand, low electricity generator availability and increasing coal and gas costs, particularly during the first 6 months of 2022. Although movements in the wholesale market cannot be controlled, we engaged in a broad response to improve the supply of energy through long term projects, including Snowy 2.0, the Hunter Power Project and support for critical transmission projects. Domestic gas market prices lower than liquefied natural gas LNG netback price Domestic gas market prices lower than liquefied natural gas LNG netback price 14.99 GJ domestic price vs netback price of 29.83 GJ Met Data source Australian Competition Consumer Commission and AEMO International markets experienced significant volatility and sustained high prices throughout the second half of the financial year, driven by global pandemic recovery and the war in Ukraine. While domestic wholesale prices were shielded from the global market s volatility in the third quarter, wholesale prices rose significantly over the last quarter as a result of the sustained high prices globally, as well as increased demand for gas generation spurred by unplanned coal generation outages, low renewable generation from wind and solar, and particularly cold weather increasing demand for gas heating. Average domestic wholesale prices have, however, remained below the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ACCC LNG netback price, which acts as a measure of the export parity price a gas supplier can expect to receive for exporting its gas. Based on price reporting by AEMO, for the full 2021 22 year, east coast wholesale gas prices averaged 14.99  GJ an increase of 143 compared to 2020 21 average price of 6.17 GJ . This was 50 below the ACCC s LNG netback price, which averaged 29.83 GJ over the same period.  53 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Performance measure 24 Target Result Assessment Average change in megajoules MJ per m2 consumed annually by office buildings as they obtain successive Building Energy Efficiency Certificates BEECs under the Commercial Building Disclosure CBD program Reduction in MJ per m2 consumed across all office buildings rated in the current period, compared with their previous BEECs under the CBD program 7 average reduction in in MJ per m2 consumed by each building rated in the 2021 22 financial year, compared to each building s previous rating Met Data source Commercial Building Customer Relationship Management CRM system Over 2021 22, we have encouraged energy and carbon savings in office buildings through the CBD program. In addition to energy efficiency improvements, this significant reduction in commercial office energy intensity over the reporting period could also in part be attributed to the impact of the global COVID 19 pandemic. Reduced office occupancy can result in reduced usage of building services, including lighting and heating, ventilation and air conditioning HVAC systems, which are responsible for a large portion of energy usage in commercial office buildings. This performance measure is calculated using building energy efficiency data submitted by CBD program assessors when applying for BEEC. For each certificate issued, the building s energy use is calculated in MJ m2 using the building s annual energy consumption in megajoules and the building s total net lettable area in metres squared. This figure is then compared to the energy usage listed in the most recently issued BEEC for that building. The total change in energy use between these values is calculated as a percentage of the older value. The reported performance measure is an average of each of these percentages. Where multiple BEECs are issued in the same financial year, only the most recent BEEC is counted. Financial performance Financial performance departmental Operating result The department recorded a surplus of 39.4 million in 2021 22 after excluding depreciation and amortisation and the impacts of Australian Accounting Standards Board AASB Standard 16 Leases accounting adjustments. This surplus is largely due to delays in implementation of various budget measures. After taking into account depreciation and amortisation, the impacts of AASB 16 Leases accounting adjustments and changes in the asset revaluation reserve, the department recorded a loss of 9.2 million for 2021 22. This reflects the introduction of the net cash appropriation arrangements where appropriation for depreciation and amortisation expenses ceased. Entities now receive a separate capital budget provided through equity appropriations. Financial sustainability As at 30 June 2022, the department reported net assets of 260.8 million. The department has sufficient financial and non financial assets to settle its payables as and when they fall due. Non financial assets owned by the department consist of property buildings and fit out , plant and equipment owned by the department.  54 CHAPTER TWO Departmental report on performance Financial performance administered Income Administered revenue largely relates to royalty revenue 1,535.3 million , dividend revenue from the Australian Government s holding in Snowy Hydro Limited 163.6 million , levy receipts generated by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority 39.2 million and registration fees generated by the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator 15.9 million . Expenses During the year the department administered programs on behalf of the government, including 381.9 million to facilitate the development and uptake of new ideas and technology and translate them into commercial outcomes and enhanced productivity 407.0 million to support the growth of innovative and competitive businesses, industries and regions, and build a diversified, flexible, resilient and dynamic economic base that can identify and adapt to new markets and emerging opportunities 1,631.7 million to support the sustainable development of the resources sector, attract private sector investment and encourage innovative technologies 490.5 million to reduce Australia s greenhouse gas emissions, contribute to effective global action on climate change, and support technological innovation in clean and renewable energy, through developing and implementing a national response to climate change. This includes 429.1 million of payments to the portfolio s corporate Commonwealth entities the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation 329.6 million to support the affordable, reliable, secure and competitive operation of energy markets for the long term benefit of the Australian community through improving Australia s energy supply, efficiency, quality, performance and productivity. This includes expenditure related to oil inventory 1,320.5 million in payments to the portfolio s corporate Commonwealth entities not listed above the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. This excludes the 429.1 million of payments to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation noted above.  55 CHAPTER 3 DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY Corporate governance Our corporate governance practices define how we manage outcome and program responsibilities, and control business internally and externally. We have an organisational board and committee structure to manage delivery of our strategic objectives. This prompts us to continually improve business and financial effectiveness, aligned with government and organisational objectives. Our governance practices comply with all statutory requirements and are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

The FSSC also assists us with the resolution of any issues that arise with the Australian National Audit Office ANAO , if and when required.  60 CHAPTER THREE Departmental management and accountability Risk management We have an important role to play in creating jobs and driving economic and productivity growth for all Australians. Effectively engaging with and managing risk is central to meeting government and community expectations. We recognise that in some circumstances it is not possible or desirable to eliminate all risk, and that accepting some degree of risk allows us to seize opportunities, promote efficiencies and support innovation. We have established systems of risk oversight, management and internal controls in accordance with Section 16 of the PGPA Act and the Commonwealth Risk Management Policy. Our Risk Management Framework is consistent with the Commonwealth Risk Management Policy and aligned with the Australian Standard ISO 31000 2018, Risk management Guidelines. It sets out a systematic approach to risk management that enables us to engage with risk in a way that fosters innovation and builds a positive risk culture. To ensure good decisions in the face of complex or uncertain operating environments, risk management is embedded in our policies, processes and systems. Climate related risk management We accept the roles and responsibilities of our staff to manage climate related risks. These obligations are underpinned by the Public Service Act 1999 , the PGPA Act, and Commonwealth Risk Management Policy, as outlined in the Australian Public Service APS responsibilities for managing climate and disaster risk statement endorsed by the Secretaries Board. We are aiming to continuously improve our climate related risk management and manage our climate related risks and opportunities according to international best practice. This includes following a rigorous climate related risk assessment framework we have used Climate Compass, a tool designed specifically for use across the APS training our staff in climate related risk to improve risk management practices and maximise our opportunities integrating our climate related risks with our enterprise risk management processes disclosing our climate related risk management practices in annual reports in alignment with the Taskforce for Climate related Financial Disclosures TCFD recommendations and the APS Climate Risk Disclosure Framework. Our detailed disclosure is included as Appendix 4. Fraud control Our approach to fraud control is consistent with the Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework 2017 and involves prevention awareness raising, risk assessment and training as the first line of defence detection monitoring of high risk areas and proactive analysis to detect possible fraud investigation and response investigation and assessment of allegations, referrals and recovery monitoring and evaluation providing assurance that our approach to fraud control is designed and operating effectively, and that it remains fit for purpose. We continue to actively raise awareness about emerging fraud risks and provide advice on potential fraud and mitigation strategies for new programs and initiatives. Officers responsible for fraud control and investigations hold the necessary qualifications required in the Australian Government Investigations Standards and the Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework.  61 CHAPTER THREE Departmental management and accountability Compliance with finance law There was one significant instance of non compliance with finance law. The significant instance of non compliance identified during the reporting period was reported to the relevant minister and the Minister for Finance. The non compliance relates to non compliance with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, and was identified by the Australian National Audit Office ANAO during a performance audit. Corrective action is being undertaken to ensure we demonstrate best practice in our management of probity in procurements and grants. External scrutiny In 2021 22, no judicial decisions, decisions of administrative tribunals or decisions by the Australian Information Commissioner had a significant impact on our operations. No capability reviews were released, and no reports on our operations were completed by either the Commonwealth Ombudsman or a committee of either or both houses of the Parliament. In 2021 22, the ANAO tabled the below listed 5 audits Administration of the Research and Development Tax Incentive Award of the Funding under the Safer Communities Fund Operation of Grants Hubs Procurement of Delivery Partners for the Entrepreneurs Programme Management of Staff Leave in the Australian Public Service. In 2021 22, the ANAO tabled 2 audits involving the portfolio The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation s Management of Nuclear Medicine Assets involved portfolio agency ANSTO Snowy 2.0 Governance of Early Implementation involved portfolio entity Snowy Hydro Limited . Details of these audits are available on the ANAO website at During 2021 22, we appeared before Senate Estimates at the following hearings Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications 25 October 2021, 14 February 2022, 31 March and 4 April 2022 Senate Standing Committee on Economics 28 October 2021, 17 February 2022, 1 and 7 April 2022. Information Publication Scheme Under Part II, section 8 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982, we were required to publish information as part of the Information Publication Scheme. Our website shows the information published in accordance with the scheme.  62 CHAPTER THREE Departmental management and accountability Our people The department has 3,553 staff in 26 locations around Australia as of 30 June 2022 . Our workforce experience is shaped by our People Strategy 2020 22 and the additional elements that target changes in areas of focus, such as our Inclusion Strategy 2021 23, Accessibility Action Plan and the Safety Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2020 23. In 2021 22, we invested in our people by developing foundational skills, offering enrichment programs, developing leadership qualities and supporting professional and career development pathways. Our people completed a broad range of foundational courses, including security, fraud and privacy awareness, work health and safety, financial frameworks as well as APS values and respectful workplace behaviours. We have the infrastructure and policies in place to support flexible working arrangements, which enabled us to continue to deliver on our policy objectives and programs for Australia in 2020 21, during the height of the COVID 19 pandemic. In consultation with staff, we reviewed our flexible work policy to ensure it leverages the lessons learnt through COVID 19 and we continue to provide access to flexible working arrangements that meets the needs of our diverse workforce. We continue to support our staff to work flexibly and safely, in line with our COVID 19 transition plan and Australian Public Service Commission guidance. Engaged and inclusive workforce Our workforce is rapidly changing and so is the Australian Public Service. We value diversity of background and experience, and recognise how this enriches our work so that we can deliver better outcomes for the Australian Government and the Australian community. Through our Inclusion Strategy 2021 23 we initiated guidance and practice that will have a lasting impact  with the aim that all our staff know that they belong and that their contributions are valued. Ways in which we have woven diversity and inclusion practice into our operations include establishing an Accessibility Committee to provide advice on how our operations could be improved enlisting an Accessibility User Group of staff with lived experience of a disability to trial new software and systems to enable programs that support our workforce to succeed renewing diversity training and introducing new programs to support staff in building a shared understanding of, and language for, an inclusive workplace. This includes LGBTIQA training, disability awareness training, and a culturally appropriate training program designed by First Nations Australians, to raise cultural awareness of staff developing a gender inclusive language guide and practical guide to supporting gender affirmation. The Australian Public Service Disability Employment Strategy 2020 25 sets out a comprehensive plan to improve employment outcomes for people with disability. This strategy aligns with the National Disability Strategy and reinforces the Australian Government s commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Disability reporting is included in the Australian Public Service Commission s APSC s State of the Service Reports and the APS Statistical Bulletin. Reconciliation Action Plan Following the successful implementation of our Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan RAP , we were invited by Reconciliation Australia to develop a Stretch RAP. This invitation is a significant achievement that recognises the commitment of staff at all levels and will be taken up by the department. Our Stretch RAP will be launched in 2022 23.  63 CHAPTER THREE Departmental management and accountability More diversity focused ways to engage staff During the reporting period, we led successful career starter programs, including internships and apprenticeships, to provide opportunities for people with diverse lived experience. Programs included Stepping Into Internship, for people with disability Indigenous Apprenticeships Program coordinated by Services Australia Soldier On Pathways Program for veterans and their immediate family. Supporting staff engagement and identity We continued our commitment to building a values led, diverse and inclusive workforce, which was reflected in policies, programs, frameworks and governance mechanisms. To support this effort, we worked closely with 6 employee led diversity networks Gender Equity Network Indigenous Employees Network Disability and Wellness Network Pride Network Cultural and Linguistic Diversity Network Flexible Workplace Network. These networks are open forums run by and for staff, and they provide employees with a safe and supportive environment to share views, perspectives and experiences. The networks significantly contributed to driving the cultural change, starting at a grassroots level, which has helped us achieve our diversity and inclusion objectives. In November 2021, we launched the Who We Are self identification campaign, which encouraged staff to update their diversity and inclusion information in our human resource system. Our networks played a central role in designing the campaign and developing the primary product, an all staff survey. Networks actively promoted the initiative with their members and other stakeholders. The campaign successfully increased self identification, in turn providing important data that allows us to target our support services and diversity and inclusion initiatives. Ways of working Opportunities for ongoing flexible working arrangements were made available to all staff. Requests to work remotely, in the office or on hybrid schedules, were supported with guidelines that enabled us to have good conversations. We invested in uplifting and improving the quality and effectiveness of everyday and challenging conversations between all managers and their staff through our capability series Connect, The Neuroscience of Quality Conversations. Through the series and leveraging technology enhanced team communication and engagement, we promoted collaboration, productivity, and connection. In 2021 22 we further invested in our people by developing foundational skills offering enrichment programs developing leadership qualities supporting professional and career development pathways. Our enrichment and leadership program offerings continued to be wide ranging and included graduate certificate level studies in public policy, participation in the Australian and New Zealand School of Government ANZSOG , and the Institute of Public Administration Australia IPAA Future Leaders course. We continued to develop critical skills in our people through data management and data foundations courses to support our digital strategy. With staff located across Australia and posted overseas, our day to day experience of working together was based on our values we are collaborative, innovative, respectful, and continually striving for excellence.  64 CHAPTER THREE Departmental management and accountability A high performing workforce We continued to grow a high performing workforce through targeted recruitment and by providing a variety of development options for existing staff, including study support, mobility opportunities, development pathways and a diverse program of learning activities to grow skills. To achieve this, we undertook a number of initiatives, including updating our suite of core learning modules to increase engagement and give staff a strong foundational understanding of behaviours and practices, including conflict of interest, financial management, security, health and safety, and integrity in the APS offering tailored study support for staff to undertake formal learning and qualifications that directly contribute to achieving better outcomes in our work program launching the inaugural scholarship program for First Nations Australians, which selects an employee to undertake dedicated study for up to 3 years. This professional development will contribute to their ongoing success as a public servant completing an annual coordinated workforce planning exercise to understand our current workforce and inform strategic workforce planning that responds to current and future needs and aligns with the APS Workforce Strategy 2025 providing opportunities across 9 programs for entry level employment pathways, including leading the recruitment for the Australian Government Graduate Program Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths STEM Stream for the APS. Commonwealth Child Safe Framework We demonstrated our commitment to the Commonwealth Child Safe Framework and fostering a safe environment for children and young people through our Child Safe Policy Working with Children and Vulnerable People Policy employee training taking active steps to identify, mitigate and manage risks to children that may be associated with its operations. Our public facing division, Questacon, has well established processes and a proactive culture to ensure the wellbeing and safety of the children it has contact with each year. Questacon s annual risk assessment, completed in consultation with health and safety representatives, identifies sources of risk and controls to ensure they remain current and effective. To reflect the strong culture of commitment to child safety, every employee, volunteer and contractor working with Questacon must maintain working with vulnerable persons registration, whether they are working face to face with children or in the back offices. We required employees to continually review programs for any activities that are associated with children, to undertake appropriate risk assessments. These risk assessments identify the level of engagement with children and young people through the program, evaluate the associated risks for harm or abuse, and establish appropriate strategies to mitigate or manage identified risks. Throughout the year, we reviewed our approach to the Child Safe Policy, supporting documents and associated training. We continue to review and build compliance to the Commonwealth Child Safety Framework to ensure the wellbeing and safety of children and young people. Executive remuneration This executive remuneration disclosure covers key management personnel as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards Board Senior Executive Service employees other highly paid staff members whose total remuneration exceeds the threshold remuneration result for the 2021 22 reporting period of 235,000.  65 CHAPTER THREE Departmental management and accountability Secretary and office holders The Remuneration Tribunal determines the Secretary s and the Chief Scientist s remuneration, which is disclosed in determinations on the tribunal s website. Typically, the tribunal reviews office holders remuneration annually. The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology determines the remuneration for the Commissioner of the Anti Dumping Commission, in accordance with the Customs Act 1901, and it is tabled under Senate Order 15. The Secretary determines the remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Space Agency, which is also tabled under Senate Order 15. Senior Executive Service employees We committed to Senior Executive Service SES performance and development arrangements that were fair, transparent and supported organisational performance. The terms and conditions of employment for SES employees are administered through individual common law contracts. The Secretary is responsible for determining remuneration for SES employees in accordance with the APS Executive Remuneration Management Policy and the Public Sector Workplace Relations Policy 2020. The SES Development Pack outlines our expectations for senior leadership. These arrangements provide a consistent basis for performance management where SES and supervisors equally commit to and understand their respective responsibilities acknowledge and recognise high performance support ongoing individual development. Our governance committee for SES performance, development and remuneration is the Leadership Council. Membership of the council consists of the Secretary and deputy secretaries. Other highly paid staff members Other highly paid staff members are covered by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science Enterprise Agreement 2019 2022. Typically, other highly paid staff members are covered by individual flexibility arrangements to secure expertise or specialist skills that are critical to business needs. We do not enter into any performance bonus payments as part of these arrangements, and they are reviewed annually.

The financial statements of the Entity, which I have audited, comprise the following as at 30 June 2022 and for the year then ended Statement by the Secretary and Chief Finance Officer Statement of Comprehensive Income Statement of Financial Position Statement of Changes in Equity Cash Flow Statement Administered Schedule of Comprehensive Income Administered Schedule of Assets and Liabilities Administered Reconciliation Schedule Administered Cash Flow Statement and Notes to and forming part of the financial statements, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Basis for opinion I conducted my audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which incorporate the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Entity in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements for financial statement audits conducted by the Auditor General and his delegates. These include the relevant independence requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants including Independence Standards the Code to the extent that they are not in conflict with the Auditor General Act 1997. I have also fulfilled my other responsibilities in accordance with the Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgement, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  81 CHAPTER FOUR Departmental financial statements Key audit matter Completeness and accuracy of royalty revenue Refer Administered Schedule of Comprehensive Income, Non taxation revenue Royalties I focused on this balance given the significant value of royalty revenue recognised by the Entity and the complexities associated with its administration. The collection of royalties is reliant on data reporting and administrative functions performed by third parties, including State and foreign governments and other federal government agencies. The royalty calculations are also dependent on information provided by taxpayers in a self assessment regime. This reliance on information sourced from third parties increases the risk that royalty revenue reported may be incomplete or inaccurate. The effectiveness of the Entity s assurance framework over the collection and administration of royalties implemented in 2021 22 is important to reduce the risk of recording incomplete or inaccurate revenue. For the year ended 30 June 2022, the Entity reported royalty revenue of 1,535.3 million. How the audit addressed the matter The audit procedures I undertook to address the matter included assessing the effectiveness of the Entity s framework for assuring the completeness and accuracy of North West Shelf royalty revenue collections, activities relating to the collection of Joint Petroleum Development Area and the Ranger Uranium Mine royalties testing, on a sample basis, a selection of internal controls undertaken by the Entity to assure the completeness and accuracy of royalty revenue examining, on a sample basis, records generated by third parties that are used to calculate the value of royalty incurring transactions to assess the accuracy of royalty revenue recognised for 2021 22 assessing the completeness of royalty revenue by examining large royalties payments received after 30 June 2022 in order to identify any royalty revenue that should have been recorded for 2021 22 and assessing the reasonableness of royalty revenue by analysing the relationship between production and commodity prices and the amount of revenue recognised. Key audit matter Valuation of Snowy Hydro Limited Refer to Note 4.1B Other Investments I focused on this area due to the size of the balance and the judgement involved in determining the fair value of the investment in Snowy Hydro Limited. The fair value of this investment has been determined on an income basis, specifically the Discounted Cash Flow approach. This involves the estimation of future revenue and earnings, significant capital expenditure, and the application of an appropriate discount rate and terminal value. Determining these assumptions involves a high level of judgement and estimation. The balance at 30 June 2022 was 8,250.0 million. How the audit addressed the matter The audit procedures I undertook to address the matter included assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methodology and the underlying assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, including the cash flow forecasts and discount rate. This involved testing of the consistency of amounts recognised in the valuation model against estimates and publications produced by Snowy Hydro Limited reviewing prior period evidence and the difference between estimates and current year actuals to assess the reliability of inputs used in the valuation process comparing key inputs including cost of capital, capitalisation multiples and terminal growth rates used in the valuation model against comparable external data where available and considering the sensitivity of the valuation methodology by adjusting key assumptions for reasonably foreseeable alternate scenarios.  82 CHAPTER FOUR Departmental financial statements Key audit matter Valuation of the Rehabilitation Provision Refer to Note 4.5B Rehabilitation Provision I focused on this area due to the size of the balance and the judgement involved in estimating the value of the rehabilitation provision. The provision relates to the rehabilitation of the Ranger Uranium Mine and the Northern Endeavour Floating Production Storage and Offtake FPSO facility and associated Laminaria Corallina oil fields. These provisions are calculated using estimated rehabilitation cost information provided by third parties. The calculations are underpinned by key assumptions including the cost and scope of the rehabilitation activities, discount rates, indexation and inflation rates and the estimated timing of cash outflows. The balance at 30 June 2022 was 2,052.3 million. How the audit addressed the matter The audit procedures I undertook to address the matter included evaluating the rationale used to estimate future rehabilitation costs, including the assessment of any key assumptions made by the Entity in assessing the third party cost estimates assessing the completeness and accuracy of cost data used by the Entity to calculate the estimate evaluating the reasonableness of the indexation, inflation and discount rates applied in calculating the provision estimates and recalculating the provision using the estimation inputs. Accountable Authority s responsibility for the financial statements As the Accountable Authority of the Entity, the Secretary is responsible under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 the Act for the preparation and fair presentation of annual financial statements that comply with Australian Accounting Standards Reduced Disclosure Requirements and the rules made under the Act. The Secretary is also responsible for such internal control as the Secretary determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Secretary is responsible for assessing the ability of the Entity to continue as a going concern, taking into account whether the Entity s operations will cease as a result of an administrative restructure or for any other reason. The Secretary is also responsible for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the assessment indicates that it is not appropriate. Auditor s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Entity s internal control  83 CHAPTER FOUR Departmental financial statements evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Accountable Authority conclude on the appropriateness of the Accountable Authority s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Entity s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern and evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. I communicate with the Accountable Authority regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit. From the matters communicated with the Accountable Authority, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

It is accompanied by the Australian Jobs Australian industry Participation Rule 2014. The Jobs Act s primary objective is to provide full, fair and reasonable opportunity for Australian entities to participate in major Australian projects. Full opportunity Australian industry has the same opportunity as other global supply chain partners to participate in all aspects of an investment project for example, design, engineering and project management . Fair opportunity Australian industry is provided the same opportunity as global suppliers to compete on an equal and transparent basis, including being given reasonable and equal time to tender. Reasonable opportunity tenders are free from non market burdens such as standards that might rule out Australian suppliers. The Jobs Act requires the development and implementation of an Australian Industry Participation AIP plan for each eligible major project with capital expenditure of 500 million or more. This could be a public or private project. Section 83 of the Jobs Act requires that the Australian Industry Participation Authority prepare an annual report on its operations. This report addresses that requirement for 2021 22. The Australian Industry Participation Authority and the Jobs Act The Jobs Act establishes a statutory position, the Australian Industry Participation Authority the Authority . On 8 December 2020, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology appointed Bruce Wilson, Head of the Industry Growth Division, as the acting AIP Authority for a 12 month term, commencing 18 January 2021. On 23 August 2021, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology appointed Donna Looney, Acting Head of the Industry Growth Division, as the acting AIP Authority for a 12 month term, commencing 2 September 2021. The authority s role is to ensure compliance with the Jobs Act evaluate, approve and publish summaries of AIP plans monitor the implementation of those plans. AIP plans apply the AIP National Framework principles. AIP plans require project proponents to maintain an understanding of Australian industry capability list the goods and services to be procured list the contact details and websites where suppliers can find information provide transparency of pre qualifications and standards used on the project offer feedback that includes areas for capability improvement and training undertake actions to encourage and facilitate capability development, for example provide reference reports, connections to global supply chains, and technology transfer. In 2021 22, the authority approved 32 AIP plans for major projects, with total capital expenditure of more than 25 billion. Projects are predominantly in the resources, infrastructure, power generation and commercial construction sectors. AIP plan summaries are published at The Jobs Act requires 6 monthly compliance reporting on the AIP plan for the project s construction phase and for the first 2 years of the operations phase for new facilities. In December 2020, a SmartForm was introduced to digitalise and streamline the AIP plan and compliance reporting process. The compliance reporting part of the SmartForm was launched in June 2021. This has reduced the administrative burden on regulated entities. In 2021 22 the authority received, evaluated and accepted 123 AIP plan compliance reports.  147 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Monitoring The authority uses a number of strategies to encourage major project proponents to comply with the Jobs Act. These include promoting awareness of the Jobs Act, engaging with project proponents to promote compliance, and monitoring compliance. In 2021 22, the Authority commenced the creation and distribution of the AIP Bulletin, which provides project proponents with information and tips on aspects of the Jobs Act, and highlights successful projects with case studies. The acting AIP Authority has spoken at major conferences to raise awareness about Jobs Act obligations. In 2021 22, the acting AIP Authority spoke at the NSW Major Projects Conference and the Australian Steel Association Conference. The Authority s monitoring of industry activity for compliance with the Jobs Act is ongoing. Information on major projects is gathered from a range of publicly available and internal sources. In 2021 22, the Authority wrote to 25 project proponents, alerting them to their potential obligations under the Jobs Act and providing guidance on meeting their obligations received formal notification of 47 major projects with current or future obligations under the Jobs Act. Self assessment The authority ran its fifth evaluation survey in 2021 22 to obtain feedback and comments on its performance from stakeholders that had their AIP plans and first compliance reports approved in 2021 22 under the Jobs Act. Survey respondents were generally positive about the SmartForms, with 70 of respondents rating the AIP plan as easy or very easy to complete. Respondents liked the more logical flow of questions, the pre populated responses to questions and the ability to send the SmartForm electronically to another team member. The overall Jobs Act compliance burden was rated as manageable or insignificant by 100 of respondents. The authority continued to look for ways to streamline its processes and reduce the compliance burden on regulated entities. The authority has been able to replace its paper based approval processes with online approvals using SmartForm. For proponents, the SmartForm AIP plan has automated the manual process of compiling a summary of the AIP plan for publication. Industry Capability Network Limited The Industry Capability Network ICN Limited supports the AIP National Framework by managing a national database of industry capability and project opportunities known as the ICN Gateway. The database connects potential Australian suppliers to public and private project opportunities. We provide annual funding to ICN Limited to deliver national coordination and IT support for the ICN. During the year, the departmental funding assisted ICN Limited to deliver on its strategic milestones, including revamping the gateway website to provide a better search capacity, and delivering ICN procurement to make it easier for businesses of all sizes, particularly local SMEs, to collaborate on major projects from procurement to payment. During the year, ICN Limited also continued to operate a new pilot industry capability register designed to help Australian manufacturers quickly and easily connect with suppliers on our behalf. Known as Capability Connection, the register was launched on 24 May 2021 and is available for businesses located in Greater Melbourne, southeast Queensland and Townsville. The authority manages funding for ICN Limited under the Australian Jobs Australian Industry Participation Rule 2014.  148 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Commonwealth procurements, grants and investments The Australian Government applies the key principles of the Australian Industry Participation National Framework to provide Australian industry with full, fair and reasonable opportunity to participate in Commonwealth funded projects. It applies key principles from the Australian Industry Participation National Framework to Australian Government procurements through the Australian Industry Participation Plans for Government Procurement grants though the Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines 2017 loans and investments by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility through their mandates payments to state and territory governments for large infrastructure projects through the National Partnership Agreement on Land Transport. Under the Commonwealth Australian Industry Participation policy, an Australian Industry Participation plan may be required from successful tenderers and funding recipients for projects where there is Commonwealth funding of 20 million or more. The team responsible for implementing policy has continued to look for ways to streamline its processes and reduce the compliance burden on regulated entities. The team has also developed and implemented a new case management database in which all Commonwealth procurements, grants and investments are recorded, and data can be analysed. In 2021 22, 24 AIP plans were approved for Commonwealth funded projects refer to Table 22 . We publish summaries of AIP plans at Table 22 2021 22 AIP plan statistics for Commonwealth funding AIP plans for Commonwealth procurements Number of AIP plans approved 8 Number of determinations that a proposed approach to market has an AIP plan requirement 5 Number of determinations that a proposed approach to market is exempt from AIP plan requirements 15 Number of determinations with an AIP clause requirements 7 AIP plans for Commonwealth grants and Commonwealth funded infrastructure projects Number of AIP plans approved 12 Number of determinations that a grant has an AIP plan requirement 2 Number of grants and projects exempted from AIP plan requirements 0 Number of determinations with an AIP clause requirements 5 AIP plans for Commonwealth investments Clean Energy Finance Corporation Number of AIP plans approved 2 Number of investments exempted from AIP plan requirements 3 AIP plans for Commonwealth investments NAIF Number of AIP plans approved 2 Number of investments exempted from AIP plan requirements due to already having a state or territory local industry participation plan 1  149 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 Section 71 of the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 the Act requires the Minister for Climate Change and Energy to prepare an annual report on the operation of the Act. This section meets this requirement for 2021 22. Purpose of the Act The Act requires the fuel industry, including fuel suppliers, to provide fuel that meets the requirements of the fuel quality standards for all grades of petrol, automotive diesel, biodiesel, ethanol E10, ethanol E85 and autogas. Review of the legislative instruments under the Act No legislative instruments were remade under the Act during 2021 22. In April 2022, we consulted with the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee FSCC on bringing forward improvements to the sulfur limit in Australian petrol from 2027 to 2024. The Australian Government implemented this change in July 2022. This will improve air quality, reducing health costs due to air pollution exposure by an estimated 840 million. Section 13 approvals In total, a delegate for the Minister granted 21 variations new approvals under section 13 of the Act, allowing fuel suppliers to provide fuels that vary from a fuel standard for a specified reason and period. This comprised a new approval for a specialist racing fuel provider to supply varied petrol until 30 June 2024. six variations for specialist racing fuel providers, extending their approvals to supply varied petrol for one year to 30 June 2023 six variations for domestic biodiesel suppliers, extending their approvals to supply diesel containing up to 20 biodiesel B20 for one year to 31 December 2022 four variations for domestic fuel producers importers, extending their approvals to supply diesel with up to 5 biodiesel B5 with varied parameters, and to supply diesel up to 20 biodiesel B20 for one year to 31 December 2022 four variations for the major domestic fuel producers importers, extending their approvals to supply varied automotive diesel. This assisted refineries in managing operational issues associated with COVID 19 travel restrictions for one year to 30 June 2023. Major importers have been included as a practicality due to co mingled storage of refinery and imported stock. Compliance and enforcement The National Measurement Institute NMI conducts monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities to detect and respond to non compliance of fuels under the Act and Fuel Quality Standards Regulations 2019. During 2021 22, NMI officers visited 384 retail fuel sites and acquired a total of 596 samples for laboratory testing as part of the Fuel Quality Monitoring Program. Where they detected non compliance, the NMI took action to ensure fuel supplied complied with the requirements of the Act. Table 23 summarises the results of the program. Table 23 Statistics on fuel sampling under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 , 2021 22 Actions 2021 22 Number of fuel sites tested 384 Number of samples laboratory tested 596 Number of non compliant samples 19 Percentage of samples non compliant 3 Number of ethanol labelling breaches 2  150 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices In 2021 22, NMI commenced a new approach by laboratory testing all samples.

The Minister for Climate Change and Energy must consult and or notify the FSCC of various matters required by the Act. The FSCC is made up of representatives from the Australian and state and territory governments, fuel producers including producers of alternative and renewable fuels , car and truck manufacturers, consumers and an environment protection organisation. Financial information The 2021 22 operating costs for administering the Act were 1,855,136.42 including staff salaries and allowances, consultancies, advertising and other related expenses. Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act 2012 This section is prepared in accordance with section 175 of the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act 2012  GEMS Act . It covers the operation of the GEMS Act from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. The GEMS Act supports the development and adoption of appliances and equipment that use less energy and result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions than competing products. Operation Equipment Energy Efficiency Program We administer the GEMS Act through the GEMS Regulator, and implement the Equipment Energy Efficiency E3 Program in Australia. The E3 Program is an initiative of the Australian Government, states and territories, and the New Zealand Government. It promotes energy efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions by enabling consumers and businesses to make more informed choices. The E3 Program primarily operates through minimum energy performance standards, which establish mandatory energy performance levels for appliances and equipment energy rating labels, which provide information about appliance and equipment energy efficiency. 10 From 1 January 2022. Up until 31 December 2021, the aromatics limit was a 45 maximum, with a 42 max pool average across all grades.  153 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Determinations At 30 June 2022, 22 determinations were in force under the GEMS Act. Determinations are legislative instruments that specify the minimum energy performance standards and labelling requirements for products regulated under the GEMS Act. Governance The department and the GEMS Regulator work cooperatively with state and territory agencies to administer the GEMS Act and develop the E3 Program under an intergovernmental agreement. Australia also collaborates on energy efficiency standards with New Zealand through a policy framework and funding arrangement for the E3 Program, ensuring the greatest net benefit for both countries. The Energy Technology Working Group oversees the E3 Program and reports to the Energy Senior Officials Meeting. The Energy Technology Working Group comprises representatives from the Australian Government, state and territory government agencies, and the New Zealand Government. Service delivery In 2021 22, the GEMS Regulator approved 5,830 applications for registration. Applications for registration were approved in 2.4 days on average, not including time in which the GEMS Regulator was awaiting additional information from the applicant. During the 2021 22 financial year, the GEMS Regulator made 5 legislative instruments granting exemptions from one or more determination requirements. Enhancements to the Energy Rating Product Registration System in 2021 22 sought to streamline the registration process and reduce the regulatory burden for businesses. They included the implementation of an automated label generator functionality and development of an automatic data upload capability for technical data, which will be trialled in 2022 2023. Further work has been undertaken on cyber security enhancements for the registration system. These include the security classification of the system and its data, the replacement of passwords with passphrases, and implementing relevant security controls from the Australian Government s Information Security Manual. This work is part of an ongoing risk assessment being done in conjunction with our cyber security team. It will ensure the system and its data is adequately protected, and it complies with Australian Government cyber security requirements. Revenue In 2021 22, revenue from registration fees was 3,301,060. Achievements During 2021 22, 2 new determinations were registered 11 The Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Swimming Pool Pump units Determination 2021 The Determination was signed by the Assistant Minister to the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction on 17 December 2021 and comes into force on 1 October 2022. The associated decision regulation impact statement estimated that, up to 2030, the Determination would provide net benefits of up to 529.2 million, with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 1.86 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent and electricity savings of 2,332 GWh. The Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Air Conditioners above 65kW Determination 2022 The Determination was signed by the Assistant Minister to the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction on 17 February 2022 and comes into force on 1 October 2022. The associated decision regulation impact statement estimated that, up to 2030, the Determination would provide net benefits of up to 37.6 million, with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 0.18 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, and electricity savings of 233 GWh. 11 The estimates in the decision regulation impact statements were based on the regulation of pool pumps coming into force on 1 January 2020, and the regulation of air conditioners above 65kW coming into force on 1 October 2021. The Determinations will not come into force until after these originally estimated dates, to ensure the new regulations are effective and industry is able to implement the new requirements. This may delay or alter the benefits estimated in the regulation impact statements.  154 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Consultation We are engaging with stakeholders including industry, consumer groups and governments, on developing draft requirements on minimum energy performance standards for Light Emitting Diode LED lamps through a LED Technical Working Group and communications for the phase out of incandescent lamps through a Lighting Energy Efficiency Advisory Group . This follows the former Council of Australian Governments Energy Council decision in 2018 to further improve lighting energy efficiency by phasing out inefficient lamps in Australia and to introduce minimum standards for LED lamps harmonised with European Union regulations. We are also working with industry and state and territory governments to begin the work of expanding energy rating labelling to include heating appliances, such as gas heaters and electric heaters. In 2021 22, consultation on a product profile on residential space heating appliances was completed. We also liaised with government and industry stakeholders through the Space Heating Equipment Technical Working Group to investigate technical options for comparing the performance of different heating technologies. In 2021 22, other consultations included an issues paper on minimum energy performance standards and labelling requirements for televisions, computer monitors and digital signage displays exposure drafts of the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Dishwashers Determination 2022, Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Rotary Clothes Dryers Determination 2022, and Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Clothes Washing Machines Determination 2022 reviews of the effectiveness and efficiency of the determinations on power distribution transformers, set top boxes, computer monitors, external power supplies, transformers and electronic step down converters for extra low voltage lamps, and ballasts for fluorescent lamps. The E3 Prioritisation Plan 2021 22 was published on 8 April 2022. The E3 Prioritisation Plan considers how the E3 work program will be aligned to accelerate policy development and focus on regulating products that will deliver the most benefits, including improving energy productivity, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing energy costs. GEMS compliance engagement, monitoring and enforcement The GEMS Regulator is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the GEMS Act. It does this through an intelligence led, risk based program that engages with and educates the regulated community, including store personnel and management retailers compliance personnel suppliers representatives and managers monitors compliance through check testing GEMS inspector online and store or supplier market surveillance receiving allegations of suspected non compliance assesses and investigates non compliance responds to non compliance. GEMS inspector market surveillance activities were conducted mainly online due to COVID 19 and extreme weather events across Australia, but once the risk to inspectors and stakeholders was reduced to a safe level, a small number of store surveys were completed. These revealed a high 94 registration compliance rate for household GEMS products a 74 registration compliance rate for industrial GEMS products labelling compliance of 71 , with 16 of energy rating labels obscured. Store surveys are expected to return to a higher frequency in coming years. In 2021 22, the GEMS Regulator selected 61 product models under 10 GEMS determinations for testing against the requirements of the GEMS Act. Of these models, 37 met GEMS Act requirements, 7 are pending test finalisation, and 17 potentially failed.  155 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices The GEMS Regulator has notified and entered into discussions with the relevant registrants in relation to the potentially failed models. Compliance action is underway to either undertake further check testing, enter into enforceable undertakings with the registrant, or the cancel the model s registration. During 2021 22, the GEMS Regulator s decision to cancel a registrant s product, after the registrant failed to comply with a notice issued under section 61 of the GEMS Act, was upheld by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Tribunal formed the conclusion that the action taken by the GEMS Regulator in issuing a notice under section 61 of the GEMS Act was valid and the exercise of discretion to cancel the registration of the product was appropriate. The GEMS Regulator regularly receives allegations of non compliance from consumers, industry and other government departments. These allegations are assessed and, if appropriate, investigated. During 2021 22, the majority of allegations received were in relation to registration and labelling non compliance. Communication The GEMS Regulator assists responsible parties to comply with the GEMS Act by informing stakeholders about the E3 Program and the operation of the GEMS Act informing stakeholders about requirements under the GEMS Act, including through the Energy Rating website, attending conferences and events, and conducting educational activities with suppliers as requested responding to queries emailed to the Energy Rating Team coordinating national marketing and communication projects to support new energy efficiency programs and improve existing ones consulting with industry and other interested parties on developing and implementing energy labelling and associated programs monitoring and reporting on program performance, achievements and enforcement. Energy rating website The energy rating website enables consumers to choose energy efficient appliances by providing information and tools such as a calculator for lifetime appliance energy costs and a mobile application to help consumers shop for energy efficient light bulbs assists suppliers and manufacturers to understand their legal obligations in relation to products regulated under the GEMS Act facilitates consultation on the development of energy efficiency policy under the E3 Program. While the website has good uptake by users, we are actively updating the website to improve the user experience by providing dedicated content streams. Updates will be completed in 2022 23. Future updates include newsletter subscription streams, energy rating calculator user experience enhancements and light bulb saver mobile application user experience enhancements, combined with technology upgrades.  156 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 The National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator NOPTA was established on 1 January 2012 and is a statutory appointment under section 695A of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 OPGGS Act . Under Section 695N 1 the Titles Administrator must, as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year, prepare and give to the responsible Commonwealth minister, for presentation to the Parliament, a report on the Titles Administrator s activities during the year. This section meets this requirement for 2021 22. NOPTA s main functions are to provide technical advice and information to the responsible Commonwealth minister and to the Joint Authority comprising the responsible Commonwealth minister and the relevant state and territory ministers keep a register of titles and collect, manage and release data. NOPTA operates on a full cost recovery basis, funded by the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas industries. NOPTA is co located with the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority and has offices in Perth and Melbourne. In 2021 22, NOPTA processed 455 titles related applications compared to 325 the previous financial year met target assessment timeframes on average more than 90 of the time completed the assessment of the first greenhouse gas storage acreage release applications since 2014 processed more than 660 regulatory data submission items and authorised the release of 97 data packages on wells and surveys held more than 690 stakeholder meetings over 57 meetings per month held annual field performance review meetings with titleholders responsible for offshore petroleum production. It also expanded NOPTA s industry benchmarking outreach program started a piece of work to modernise the National Offshore Petroleum Information Management System. This includes integration with NOPTA s systems, ultimately leading the online submission of data continued to improve the National Electronic Approvals Tracking System secure portal to help online titles related submissions with digital signature technology worked with the Offshore Resources Branch to implement the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Titles Administration and Other Measures Act 2021. This included the release of a suite of new application forms, and the creation update of 12 factsheets and guidelines created the Offshore Petroleum Forum OPF . This consists of Joint Authority delegates and its respective departments , NOPSEMA and Geoscience Australia representatives published the 2020 21 Annual Report of Activities. This gives an overview of key activities and performance outcomes relevant to NOPTA s administrative functions. Work Health and Safety Act 2011 We maintain a strong commitment to the health and wellbeing of all employees and visitors. During 2021 22, we continued our commitment to initiatives that promote the health, safety and welfare of our workers. In addition to undertaking reviews of materials, policies and guidelines to make sure these were effective, we launched a holistic wellbeing package to support employees physical, emotional and psychological wellbeing in the workplace and their personal lives that will be updated biannually. The package is multidisciplinary in approach and supports all aspects of safety and wellbeing, including a person s physical, mental, emotional and social health factors launched the Wellbeing Hub, which provides information, guides and helpful tips for staff to support their own wellbeing journey  157 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices launched InjuryAssist, an internal early intervention triage and treatment program that provides staff with immediate medical advice for a work related injury, illness or symptoms. The service offers a first response for psychological and physical conditions engaged CancerAid to provide 2 types of free confidential programs for staff touched by cancer. The programs add to other support services, including InjuryAssist, the Wellbeing Hub and the Employee Assistance Program finalised the APS Mental Health Capability Framework. We are now rated as having well defined maturity across most domains, particularly initiatives relating to organisational, cultural and senior leadership. The forward work plan for 2022 23 will articulate evidence informed and behaviourally anchored actions to strengthen maturity against the framework. In 2021 22, 5 incidents were deemed notifiable under section 38 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 and reported to Comcare. Three of the 5 were related to COVID 19. Zero investigations were conducted, and zero notices were issued under Part 10 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011. Our Comcare premium rate remains low. The workers compensation indicative premium rate reduced again during the reporting period, due to factors such as our safety, wellbeing and rehabilitation culture, number of workplace incidents resulting in injury or illness, and return to work outcomes. Regulatory functions We delivered a number of regulatory functions in 2021 22 to support strong settings for business, markets and the economy. We continue to strengthen and refine our role as a regulator to support and enhance regulatory settings for businesses and the Australian community. The delivery of legislated objectives, functions and roles can be as important as the content of the regulations being administered, including regulator performance, capability and culture. We incorporated regulatory performance measures in the Corporate Plan 2021 22. We then cross referenced the Corporate Plan 2021 22 performance measures with the list of regulators in the table below in the column titled CP PM . We worked with all of our regulators with a focus on the 3 principles of regulator best practice 1. Continuous improvement and building trust regulators adopt a whole of system perspective, continuously improving their performance, capability and culture to build trust and confidence in Australia s regulatory settings. 2. Risk based and data driven regulators manage risks proportionately and maintain essential safeguards while minimising regulatory burden, and leveraging data and digital technology to support those they regulate to comply and grow. 3. Collaboration and engagement regulators are transparent and responsive communicators, implementing regulations in a modern and collaborative way. Table 29 provides a list of the regulators for which the Secretary was the Accountable Authority during the period, their relevant legislation and links to the relevant performance measures in the Corporate Plan 2021 22. Two case studies that demonstrate regulator performance in alignment with the best practice principles over the reporting period are provided below.  158 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Table 29 List of regulators, their relevant legislation and links to performance measures Regulator and regulator function Legislation CP PM Anti Dumping Commission Administers the antidumping and countervailing system.

NMI s team of field inspectors audit businesses and assist them to comply with measurement law. A 2022 national audit of a business sector highlighted how NMI fulfilled the aims of the best practice regulatory principles of continuous improvement and building trust risk based and data driven collaboration and engagement. NMI trade measurement inspectors ran a week long audit of licensed premises in March 2022, checking the sale of beer and prescribed spirits at more than 300 venues across the country. The Licensed Premises Program was focused on pubs, clubs, hotels and breweries, selected on a risk based, data driven basis. The program was designed so consumers can trust that they receive what they pay for. It also aimed to give licensed venues confidence that their trading practices are up to standard and their profits are not affected by inaccurate measurements. Where businesses were re establishing after long lockdowns or natural disasters, NMI inspectors targeted audits to provide support, advice and assurance that their instruments were still compliant. Where employees were newly recruited, or had been away from work for extended periods, NMI engagement promoted further compliance improvements through education and advice on trading practices required under the National Measurement Act. NMI inspectors also had up to date information to handle enquiries on the government support available for COVID 19 and disaster recovery efforts. NMI engaged with industry on workplace training and educational resources for the sector, and collaborated with the Australian Hotels Association AHA to develop guidance material. Prior to the execution of the 2022 program, both the AHA and NMI separately capitalised on media opportunities to promote the importance of measurement in the licensed premises sector, and ensured a consistent message was being delivered. The audit generated a high amount of media and public interest, helping to spread the word about trader obligations and consumer rights. Outcomes of the audit will be published in NMI s annual compliance report.  160 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Case study The Australian Industry Participation Authority s Implementation of Jobs Act SmartForm The Australian Industry Participation AIP Authority is the regulator responsible for ensuring compliance by major project proponents with the Australian Jobs Act 2013 the Jobs Act . Proponents are required to develop an AIP plan and then report on their compliance with it every 6 months. Previously, AIP plan and compliance reports had been prepared on paper based templates, which were time consuming for proponents and prone to errors. We took the opportunity to employ digital technology by moving to online SmartForm AIP plans and compliance reports. The SmartForm was developed in collaboration with stakeholders through a focus group and survey to gather ideas on what features to include. Developing the new form also gave the opportunity to streamline the forms by reducing the number of questions. The SmartForm has a number of advantages such as pre populated responses, address and ABN checkers, and the ability to place feedback comments into the form. It also automated a previously manual process for developing a summary of the AIP plan for publication. The implementation of the SmartForm has had a transformative effect on both the regulated community and the regulator. Proponents have responded with positive comments reflecting that implementing the SmartForm has significantly reduced the time and effort taken to complete the process. The form has also increased the regulator s efficiency through inbuilt workflows that enable online approvals.  161 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Appendix A2 Workforce statistics Whole of department, all ongoing employees Public Service Act 1999 Table 30 Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources Public Service Act 1999.

We are committed to the 5 principles of ecologically sustainable development ESD integration precaution intergeneration biodiversity valuation. This is demonstrated through the way we develop and deliver policies, plans, programs, legislation, advice, and education and scientific services that reflect economic, environmental and social sustainability. Below are some examples of our commitment to the 5 principles of ecologically sustainable development in 2021 22. Delivery of Rum Jungle and Maralinga rehabilitation projects We continued to work with the Northern Territory Government, Kungarakan and Warai Traditional Owners and other stakeholders in advance of commencement of works at the Rum Jungle Rehabilitation Project, subject to receipt of environmental approvals. We also worked with the Government of South Australia and Maralinga Tjarutja Traditional Owners to finalise plans to remediate debris pits located throughout the site that have eroded over time. Debris pits contain general waste for example, building rubble and scrap metal used in the British atomic testing program or subsequent rehabilitation projects. The Australian Government announced funding for the Maralinga Site Maintenance Project as part of the mid year economic and fiscal outlook 2021. How it accords with the principles of ESD Project planning took into account current environmental condition and potential environmental impacts. How it furthers or advances ESD principles Environmental risk assessments were incorporated into project planning.  176 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Investment in clean and renewable energy technology through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation CEFC The Australian Renewable Energy Agency ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation CEFC provide grants and loans in support of investment and innovation in renewables and clean energy CEFC made clean energy investment commitments of almost 2 billion across 63 projects. These investments covered solar, wind, energy storage, electric vehicles and other technologies across diverse sectors including agriculture, buildings, manufacturing, mining, transport and utilities. ARENA committed over 200 million in grants to 49 projects. Grants included support for research, development and deployment of electric vehicles, enabling technologies, hydrogen, energy storage, solar PV, solar thermal and wind energy. ARENA and CEFC also share insights and data from market leading research initiatives and knowledge from financed projects to promote greater understanding about the potential of low emission innovations and investments. ARENA and CEFC accelerate the transition to net zero emissions, reducing the severity of climate change. How it accords with the principles of ESD ARENA and CEFC accord with the precaution, integration and intergeneration principles. The agencies accelerate the transition to net zero emissions and reduce the associated potential risks for future generations. How it furthers or advances ESD principles ARENA and CEFC advance ESD principles by helping to foster the long term sustainability of Australia s energy sector while promoting the reduction of energy related greenhouse gas emissions. The CEFC and ARENA also release ESD performance statements in their annual reports. Decommissioning of the Northern Endeavour Floating Production Storage and Offtake Facility and remediating the associated Laminaria and Corallina oil fields In 2021 22, we maintained the safety of persons on board the Northern Endeavour Floating Production Storage and Offtake facility and parliament passed legislation to impose a temporary levy on industry to recover the costs of decommissioning and remediating the oilfields and associated infrastructure to prevent taxpayers from being burdened with these costs. On 30 March 2022, we signed a 325 million  excluding GST contract with Petrofac Facilities Management Limited to deliver Phase 1 of the decommissioning works. Phase 1 will involve the decommissioning and disconnection of the FPSO from the subsea equipment. How it accords with the principles of ESD Decommissioning the Northern Endeavour and associated oil fields will remove future potential risks and protect the environment in the most cost effective way for taxpayers. This accords with the integration principle. The Australian Government s costs of decommissioning will be recouped through the Laminaria and Corallina Decommissioning Cost Recovery Levy.The levy is an important measure to ensure that taxpayers are not left to pay for the decommissioning and remediation of the oil fields. This accords with the integration principle. How it furthers or advances ESD principles Decommissioning will ensure the safe removal of oil and gas production infrastructure and rehabilitation of the marine environment. Decommissioning is a regulatory requirement.  177 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Remake of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Environment Regulations 2009 Environment Regulations We continued to work with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to remake the Environment Regulations before they sunset cease to be law on 1 April 2024. To preserve continuity of regulatory coverage ahead of the current regulations sunsetting, the Environment Regulations will be remade in 2022 23 without substantive policy change. Minor technical amendments will be made to modernise the provisions and their language to align with current practice. These amendments include the restructuring and renumbering of the provisions. The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority NOPSEMA administers the Environment Regulations. A proposed petroleum activity cannot proceed unless NOPSEMA is satisfied that the impacts and risks to the environment from the activity will be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable ALARP and acceptable levels. How it accords with the principles of ESD The Environment Regulations need to be remade before they sunset cease to be law on 1 April 2024. This will ensure that titleholders continue to be required to carry out petroleum activities in a manner that is consistent with the principles of ESD. How it furthers or advances ESD principles The Environment Regulations require titleholders to identify, assess and reduce all environmental impacts and risks including socio economic of their petroleum activities to as low as reasonably practicable ALARP and acceptable levels. Development of a guidance framework to support more collaborative coexistence between the petroleum industry and the commercial fishing industry in the Commonwealth marine area Under Australia s marine management framework, no single user has exclusive rights to the offshore area. Since early 2021, along with the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, and NOPSEMA we have facilitated an engagement process with the offshore petroleum and commercial fishing industries to develop the guidance framework. This process included several government facilitated workshops and meetings between the industries. The finalisation of the framework has been held over until it can be considered and endorsed by the new Australian Government. It is expected to be published in late 2022. How it accords with the principles of ESD The guidance framework supports the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, which requires petroleum operators to carry out offshore activities in a manner that does not interfere with other marine users rights to a greater extent than is necessary. How it furthers or advances ESD principles The adoption of the principles in the guidance framework by both industries should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the Commonwealth marine area environment including commercial fisheries is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations.  178 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Energy efficiency standards and energy labelling for equipment and appliances through regulation under the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act 2012 GEMS Act . The Equipment Energy Efficiency E3 program, which is underpinned by requirements under the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act 2012, aims to improve the energy efficiency of appliances in Australia and New Zealand. This lowers emissions, reducing the impact of climate change on the environment for future generations. How it accords with the principles of ESD We work with state and territory governments and New Zealand, to set minimum standards and labelling requirements under the GEMS Act. How it furthers or advances ESD principles GEMS regulation promotes the use of energy efficient equipment and appliances. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions, helping preserve the environment for future generations. Monitoring of environmental regulation and reform, and analysing its impact on the resources sector We worked in conjunction with the environment portfolio and resources sector to reform environmental legislation under the EPBC Act. This provided more certainty to the resources sector regarding environmental approvals, reduced duplicative regulation and increased investment in Australian industries. How it accords with the principles of ESD We provide advice to the Australian Government on how environmental regulation will impact the resources sector to make sure long term and short term economic factors are considered in decision making. How it furthers or advances ESD principles We consider referrals under the EPBC Act to ensure the Australian Government is aware of the economic impacts of resource projects. We also engage in reviews to the EPBC Act and subsequent reforms. Submission of a referral under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 ARWA submitted a referral under the EPBC Act to the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment DAWE , following the declaration of a site near Kimba in South Australia for the National Radioactive Waste Management Facility NRWMF . The NRWMF project was determined a controlled action under the Act, so ARWA will prepare an environmental impact statement as a component of the NRWMF requirements to meet stringent environmental and safety standards. How it accords with the principles of ESD ARWA is working with regulators, Traditional Owners and other stakeholders and experts to ensure the NRWMF meets stringent environmental and safety standards. How it furthers or advances ESD principles Safety and the environment continue to be key components of the regulatory approvals, design, construction and operations of the NRWMF.  179 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Consideration of ESD requirements in the design of various buildings at the planned National Radioactive Waste Management Facility NRWMF ARWA worked with ANSTO and Jacobs Engineering Group to design the various buildings for the NRWMF. The visitors centre and site operations building were selected as sample buildings to incorporate design features to meet the requirements for a 6 Star Green Star rating. If successful at meeting the 6 star requirement, this process will then be followed for other key buildings on the NRWMF site. How it accords with the principles of ESD ARWA is working with ANSTO and Jacobs Engineering Group which provides engineering, technical, professional and construction services to take into account ESD requirements with the design of various key buildings for the NRWMF. How it furthers or advances ESD principles The design of a visitor s centre and site operations building are underway as test cases with the intention that these buildings and others, if this proves successful meet the requirements for a 6 Star Green Star rating. Environmental monitoring services for Australia Through the NMI, we have provided specialised environmental analysis services to the Australian Government, regulators and industry to help meet environmental legislative requirements. For example, to help manage perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances compounds. NMI s definitive analytical results lead to higher quality risk assessments and management of environmental issues and NMI s ultra trace level testing for persistent organic pollutants including dioxins is unique in Australia. NMI also sought to maintain systems that reduce impacts on the environment. For example, NMI supported the safe and effective operation of gas supply networks through its unique services for gas flowmeter calibration. Accurate and trusted calibration of flowmeters helped network operators to minimise the risk of fugitive emissions from gas pipelines. NMI also captures and re uses gases previously released during calibration of LPG flowmeters at NMI s Londonderry Flow Facility, which both improves safety and reduces greenhouse emissions. How it accords with the principles of ESD Through the National Measurement Institute NMI , we provide specialised environmental analysis services to the Australian Government, regulators and industry. How it furthers or advances ESD principles NMI s definitive analytical results lead to higher quality risk assessments and management of environmental issues.  180 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Implementation of Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Framework We are implementing the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Framework to enable development of offshore renewable energy infrastructure. In the 2021 22 year, we worked with around 12 other Commonwealth stakeholders, including the then Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, to incorporate environmental considerations into the design of declared areas to enable coexistence and minimise environmental impacts. The proposed area, off shore of Gippsland in Victoria, was announced on 5 August 2022 for public feedback. How it accords with the principles of ESD Assessment of areas for suitability for offshore electricity infrastructure considers environmental matters before being declared suitable. How it furthers or advances ESD principles The assessment process incorporates consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment to promote awareness and consideration of environmental matters. Formation of QNetZero for Questacon The National Science and Technology Centre to meet carbon neutrality by 2030 Questacon will deliver services with net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. As the first step to gain a carbon neutral certification, Questacon completed an emissions audit and identified key emissions sources in 2021. This baseline will be used to track future performance and progress towards lower emissions. QNetZero will also engage Australians in minimising their own climate impact. How it accords with the principles of ESD Questacon s program accords with the intergeneration, precaution and biodiversity principles. Questacon is helping future generations become aware of the effects of climate change and ways they can minimise their own climate impact. How it furthers or advances ESD principles Through the QNetZero program, Questacon is further educating Australians about the importance of sustainability and is promoting ways that it can lower its own carbon footprint. Questacon works across generations, engaging with children, families and educators on the importance of sustainability. QNetZero will be integrated into Questacon s business plan and day to day operations. Internal operations environmental performance A report on the environmental performance of our internal operations can be found at  181 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Appendix A4 Climate Risk Disclosure Framework Statement Climate related risk We have been taking steps to identify and manage climate related risks to our policies, programs, asset management, service delivery and portfolio functions. Governance The department is an active member of the Australian Government Disaster and Climate Resilience Reference Group RRG . This group is responsible for driving a whole of government approach to disaster and climate resilience, risk reduction and climate adaptation. The department s Executive Board is committed to supporting the Australian Government s net zero targets and climate adaptation goals, including the management of climate related risks and opportunities. The Executive Board has responsibility for overseeing the application and management of the department s Risk Management Framework and is the collective owner of enterprise strategic and enterprise operational risks. Specifically, the Executive Board sets the strategic direction for management of climate risks and opportunities, including how it can affect the outcomes and functions of the department ensures climate risk and opportunities are embedded in department wide strategic and corporate plans and internal policies supports the building of capability to accurately assess and effectively respond to the department s climate risks and opportunities oversees progress, performance and reporting. Under the current Risk Management Framework Figure 7 , the Executive Board is supported in managing and monitoring climate related risks by a number of the department s committees. In particular, the Executive Board is supported by the Assurance and Audit Committee, which is responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the risk oversight and management system, and systems of internal control. The Governance and Risk Team also actively monitors our enterprise risk profile, including climate related risks, and assists the Executive Board in managing such risks. This ensures that relevant areas are assessing and managing climate risks that may affect work, and that up to date climate risk information is reported to the Executive Board alongside other risk updates.  182 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Figure 7.

While physical risks are well understood in critical areas, we are working to embed a comprehensive understanding of climate related risks and opportunities across the whole department, including transitional risks and opportunities related to our portfolio responsibilities. This will include developing greater capability and capacity to support the growth of industries as they reduce emissions, and related economic changes. We will continue to build staff s climate related risk management capabilities including through climate risk learning and development measures, and improving staff access to climate risk management information via our intranet. Risk management We have recently completed a Climate Compass scan across the department excluding portfolio agencies . Each branch was invited to discuss their climate related risks and opportunities with our internal Climate Compass project team who guided the discussion and recorded their responses to the scan. The Climate Compass framework is intended to identify climate related risks and opportunities in our policies, programs, asset management, service delivery and portfolio functions. The Climate Compass project team analysed the responses for organisation wide trends, themes and priorities. It found that in the most critical areas where climate impacts are already being felt, such as transmission infrastructure resilience and emergency management, climate related risks are being carefully considered and well managed. However, there is work to be done to gain a more complete understanding across all areas of the organisation especially, in improving our transitional risk management and growing our capabilities to maximise our opportunities. The findings of the Climate Compass scan have been considered by the Executive Board along with several recommendations to enhance our climate related risk management practices, including improving integration with general risk management practices, expanding learning and development opportunities, and a commitment to continue to disclose according to the TCFD aligned APS Climate Risk Disclosure Framework. 12 Metrics and targets Following the May 2022 election, the Australian Government committed to reduce the Australian Public Service s emissions to net zero by 2030. The department will actively contribute to this commitment. The department will commence work to identify opportunities to reduce our emissions through operational changes and will consider systems for measuring, monitoring and reporting on progress towards meeting the 2030 target. The department s corporate planning includes improving climate related risk management capabilities across the department. The relevant initiatives, targets, how these targets are measured, and the current status is reported in Table 47. 12 To be TCFD aligned refers to following Taskforce on Climate related Financial Disclosures TCFD recommendations when preparing disclosure statements. This statement follows the APS Climate Risk Disclosure Framework, which is closely based on the TCFD recommendations. However, it should be noted that not all recommendations were able to be disclosed against in this financial year.  184 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Table 47 Summary of DISR s key climate related risk management initiatives, targets, metrics and status of the project Initiative Target Metric Status Develop a greenhouse gas GHG emissions inventory to support the Australian Government s commitment to a net zero APS by 2030 Net zero by 2030 GHG emissions, Scope 1 and 2 Commencement and progress of GHG inventory development Planned Develop an emissions reduction plan for DISR to support the Australian Government s commitment to a net zero APS by 2030 Net zero by 2030 Annual emissions reductions achieved Cost of emissions reduction measures Cost of carbon credits Co benefits Planned Increase the capability of department staff to consider climate related risks and opportunities where they relate to their role Continue to grow the percentage of staff who have completed the online climate risk learning and development training Number of staff who successfully completed the online climate related risk training modules In progress Build climate risk considerations into key corporate policies and frameworks to prompt consideration of climate risks and opportunities Climate risk is incorporated into the enterprise risk management and project management framework by 30 June 2023 Climate related risk is integrated into updated enterprise risk management and project management frameworks In progress Demonstrate leadership in the management of climate related risks and opportunities To disclose against all 11 recommended disclosures outlined in the TCFD recommendations and APS Climate Risk Disclosure Framework. Take an active role in APS wide knowledge sharing and development of standards and best practices. Number of recommendations disclosed against Progress on previous year s statements Active participation in interdepartmental activities In progress  185 CHAPTER FIVE Departmental appendices Appendix A5 Corrections to previous annual reports Our Annual Report 2020 21 contained the following errors Annual Performance Statements page 26 Our Annual Report 2020 21 should have read Cooperative Research Centres Program In 2020 21, the Cooperative Research Centre CRC Program supported 1,799 business and research organisations as partners in CRCs and CRC Projects CRC Ps . This was made up of 11,564 1,164 partners in CRCs and 635 partners in CRC Ps. The 2020 21 result is an increase on the 14,586 1,486 partners supported in 2019 20. Staff remuneration page 59 Under the heading Executive remuneration, the third dot point in the introduction states other highly paid staff members whose total remuneration exceeds the threshold remuneration amount for the 2020 21 reporting period, being 225,000 . The threshold increased to 230,000 for 2020 21. The table on page 62 describes the other highly paid staff threshold from 230,001. The reported results are correct. Compliance checklist item 17AE 2 page 332 This requirement was reported as not applicable in the compliance checklist.
