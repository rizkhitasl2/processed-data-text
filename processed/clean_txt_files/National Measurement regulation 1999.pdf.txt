standard of measurement must state a the name and address of the verifying authority and b that the standard is verified as a reference standard of measurement i if a verifying authority verified the standard by the verifying authority or ii if a verifying authority supervised verification of the standard under the supervision of the verifying authority and c the date of verification and d the value ascertained for the standard on that date in terms of an Australian legal unit of measurement and e the accuracy with which the standard is verified and f the value stating the uncertainty of any relevant environmental or other influence factors, like temperature and pressure, at the time of the verification and g a description of any mark on or attached to, the standard under these
