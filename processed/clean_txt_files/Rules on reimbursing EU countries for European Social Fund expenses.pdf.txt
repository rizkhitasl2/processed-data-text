REGULATIONS COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION EU 2015 2195 of 9 July 2015 on supplementing Regulation EU No 1304 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Social Fund, regarding the definition of standard scales of unit costs and lump sums for reimbursement of expenditure by the Commission to Member States THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Regulation EU No 1304 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Social Fund and repealing Council Regulation EC No 1081 2006 1 , and in particular Article 14 1 thereof, Whereas 1 The standard scales of unit costs and lump sums for reimbursement to Member States should be established on the basis of methods submitted by Member States and assessed by the Commission, including the methods set out in Article 67 5 of Regulation EU No 1303 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 2 and Articles 14 2 and 14 3 of Regulation EU No 1304 2013. 2 Taking into account the different types of operations the European Social Fund may support, the definition and amounts of standard scales of unit costs and lump sums may have to differ by type of operation in order to reflect their specificities. 3 There are significant disparities between Member States and in certain cases regions within a Member State, regarding the level of costs for a type of operation. In line with the principle of sound financial management for the European Social Fund, the definition and amounts of standard scales of unit costs and lump sums established by the Commission should also reflect the specificities of each Member State and region. 4 In order to allow that the amounts of standard scales of unit costs reflect the level of costs actually incurred, a method is devised to adjust them. HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION Article 1 Subject matter and scope This Regulation establishes the standard scales of unit costs and lump sums that may be used by the Commission for reimbursing expenditure to Member States. 28.11.2015 L 313 22 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 470. 2 Regulation EU No 1303 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and repealing Council Regulation EC No 1083 2006 OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 320 .
