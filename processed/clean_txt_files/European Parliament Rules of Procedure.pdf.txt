The European Parliament is the assembly elected pursuant to the Treaties, the Act of 20 September 1976 concern ing the election of the members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage and national legislation deriving from the Treaties. 2. Persons elected to the European Parliament shall be referred to as Членове на Европейския парламент in Bulgarian, Diputados al Parlamento Europeo in Spanish, Poslanci Evropského parlamentu in Czech, Medlemmer af Europa Parlamentet in Danish, Mitglieder des Europäischen Parlaments in German, Euroopa Parlamendi liikmed in Estonian, Βoυλευτές τoυ Ευρωπαϊκoύ Κoιvoβoυλίoυ in Greek, Members of the European Parliament in English, Députés au Parlement européen in French, Feisirí de Pharlaimint na hEorpa in Irish, Zastupnici u Europskom parlamentu in Croatian, Deputati al Parlamento europeo in Italian, Eiropas Parlamenta deputāti in Latvian, Europos Parlamento nariai in Lithuanian, Európai Parlamenti Képviselők in Hungarian, Membri tal Parlament Ewropew in Maltese, Leden van het Europees Parlement in Dutch, Posłowie do Parlamentu Europejskiego in Polish, Deputados ao Parlamento Europeu in Portuguese, Deputaţi în Parlamentul European in Romanian, Poslanci Európskeho parlamentu in Slovak, Poslanci Evropskega parlamenta in Slovenian, Euroopan parlamentin jäsenet in Finnish, Ledamöter av Europaparlamentet in Swedish. 22.11.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 302 11  Rule 2 Independent mandate In accordance with Article 6 1 of the Act of 20 September 1976 and with Article 2 1 and Article 3 1 of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, Members shall exercise their mandate freely and independently, shall not be bound by any instructions and shall not receive a binding mandate. Rule 3 Verification of credentials 1. Following general elections to the European Parliament, the President shall invite the competent authorities of the Member States to notify Parliament without delay of the names of the elected Members so that all Members may take their seats in Parliament with effect from the opening of the first sitting following the elections. At the same time, the President shall draw the attention of those authorities to the relevant provisions of the Act of 20 September 1976 and invite them to take the necessary measures to avoid any incompatibility with the office of Member of the European Parliament. 2. Members whose election has been notified to Parliament shall declare in writing, before taking their seat in Parlia ment, that they do not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament within the mean ing of Article 7 1 or 2 of the Act of 20 September 1976. Following general elections, the declaration shall be made, where possible, no later than six days prior to Parliament s first sitting following the elections. Until such time as Mem bers credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, and provided that they have previously signed the above mentioned written declaration, they shall take their seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto. Where it is established from facts verifiable from sources available to the public that a Member holds an office incom patible with that of Member of the European Parliament, within the meaning of Article 7 1 or 2 of the Act of 20 September 1976, Parliament, on the basis of the information provided by its President, shall establish that there is a vacancy. 3. On the basis of a report by the committee responsible, Parliament shall verify credentials without delay and rule on the validity of the mandate of each of its newly elected Members and also on any disputes referred to it pursuant to the provisions of the Act of 20 September 1976, other than those which, under that Act, fall exclusively under the national provisions to which that Act refers. The committee s report shall be based on the official notification by each Member State of the full results of the elec tion, specifying the names of the candidates elected and those of any substitutes, together with their ranking in accor dance with the results of the vote. The validity of the mandate of a Member may not be confirmed unless the written declarations required under this Rule and Annex I to these Rules of Procedure have been made. 4. On the basis of a proposal by the committee responsible, Parliament shall, without delay, verify the credentials of individual Members who are replacing outgoing Members and may at any time rule on any dispute as to the validity of the mandate of any of its Members. 5. Where the appointment of a Member is due to the withdrawal of candidates from the same list, the committee responsible shall ensure that the withdrawal in question has taken place in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Act of 20 September 1976 and Rule 4 2 . 6. The committee responsible shall ensure that any information which may affect the eligibility of the Member or the eligibility or the ranking of the substitutes is forwarded to Parliament without delay by the authorities of the Member States or of the Union, with, in the case of an appointment, an indication of the date on which it will take effect. Should the competent authorities of the Member States initiate a procedure which might lead to the disqualification of a Member from holding office, the President shall ask them to keep him or her regularly informed of the stage reached in the procedure and shall refer the matter to the committee responsible. On a proposal from that committee, Parlia ment may adopt a position on the matter. L 302 12 EN Official Journal of the European Union 22.11.2019  Rule 4 Term of office of Members 1. A Member s term of office begins and ends as laid down in Articles 5 and 13 of the Act of 20 September 1976. 2. Members who resign shall notify the President of their resignation and of the date on which that resignation is to take effect, which may not be more than three months after notification. This notification shall take the form of an official record drawn up in the presence of the Secretary General or his or her representative, signed by the latter and by the Member concerned and immediately submitted to the committee responsible, which shall enter it on the agenda of its first meeting following receipt of the document. If the committee responsible considers that the resignation is in compliance with the Act of 20 September 1976, a vacancy shall be declared with effect from the date indicated by the resigning Member in the official record, and the President shall inform Parliament thereof. If the committee responsible considers that the resignation is not in compliance with the Act of 20 September 1976, it shall propose to Parliament that it not declare a vacancy. 3. Where no meeting of the committee responsible is scheduled before the next part session, the rapporteur of the committee responsible shall immediately examine any resignation that has been duly notified. Where delay in consider ing the notification would be prejudicial, the rapporteur shall refer the matter to the committee Chair, requesting, pur suant to paragraph 2, that the President be informed on behalf of the committee that a vacancy may be declared, or an extraordinary meeting of the committee be convened to examine specific difficulties noted by the rapporteur. 4. Where either the competent authorities of the Member States or of the Union or the Member concerned notifies the President of an appointment or election to an office that is incompatible with the office of Member of the European Parliament within the meaning of Article 7 1 or 2 of the Act of 20 September 1976, the President shall inform Parlia ment thereof, and Parliament shall declare that a vacancy exists from the date of the incompatibility. Where the competent authorities of the Member States notify the President of the end of the term of office of a Member of the European Parliament as a result either of an additional incompatibility established by the law of that Member State in accordance with Article 7 3 of the Act of 20 September 1976 or of the withdrawal of the Member s mandate pursuant to Article 13 3 of that Act, the President shall inform Parliament that the term of office of that Member ended on the date communicated by competent authorities of the Member State. Where no such date is communicated, the date of the end of the term of office shall be the date of the notification by that Member State. 5. Where the authorities of the Member States or of the Union inform the President of an assignment they intend to entrust to a Member, the President shall refer to the committee responsible the question of the compatibility of the proposed assignment with the Act of 20 September 1976 and shall inform Parliament, the Member and the authorities concerned of the conclusions reached by that committee. 6. When Parliament has established a vacancy, the President shall inform the Member State concerned thereof, and invite it to fill the seat without delay. 7. Where acceptance or termination of office appears to be based on material inaccuracy or vitiated consent, Parlia ment may declare the appointment under consideration to be invalid or may refuse to establish the vacancy. Rule 5 Privileges and immunities 1. Members enjoy the privileges and immunities laid down in the Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union. 2. In exercising its powers on privileges and immunities, Parliament shall act to uphold its integrity as a democratic legislative assembly and to ensure the independence of its Members in the performance of their duties. Parliamentary immunity is not a Member s personal privilege but a guarantee of the independence of Parliament as a whole, and of its Members. 22.11.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 302 13  3. A laissez passer of the European Union allowing a Member to circulate freely in the Member States and in other countries which recognise it as a valid travel document shall be issued by the European Union to a Member at his or her request, on condition that the President of the Parliament gives his or her authorisation. 4. For the purpose of performing their parliamentary duties, all Members shall have the right to participate actively in the work of Parliament s committees and delegations in accordance with the provisions of these Rules of Procedure. 5. Members shall be entitled to inspect any files held by Parliament or a committee, other than personal files and accounts, which only the Members concerned shall be allowed to inspect. Exceptions to this rule, concerning the han dling of documents to which public access may be denied, pursuant to Regulation EC No 1049 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 , are laid down in Rule 221. With the approval of the Bureau, a Member may, on the basis of a reasoned decision, be denied the right to inspect a Parliament document if, after hearing the Member concerned, the Bureau comes to the conclusion that such an inspection would cause unacceptable damage to Parliament s institutional interests or to the public interest, and that the Member concerned is seeking to inspect the document for private and personal reasons. The Member may lodge a written appeal against such a decision within one month of the notification thereof. In order to be admissible, written appeals must include reasons. Parliament shall reach a decision on the appeal without debate during the part session that follows its lodging. Access to confidential information is subject to the rules laid down in interinstitutional agreements concluded by Parliament relating to the treatment of confidential information 2 and to the internal rules for their implementation adopted by Parliament s competent bodies 3 . Rule 6 Waiver of immunity 1. Any request for waiver of immunity shall be evaluated in accordance with Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union and with the principles referred to in Rule 5 2 . 2. Where Members are required to appear as witnesses or expert witnesses, there is no need to request a waiver of immunity, provided that they will not be obliged to appear on a date or at a time which prevents them from performing their parlia mentary duties, or makes it difficult for them to perform those duties, or that they will be able to provide a state ment in writing or in any other form which does not make it difficult for them to perform their parliamentary duties, and that they are not obliged to testify concerning information obtained confidentially in the performance of their par liamentary duties which they do not see fit to disclose. Rule 7 Defence of privileges and immunity 1. In cases where it is alleged that an infringement of the privileges and immunities of a Member or former Member by the authorities of a Member State has occurred or is about to occur, a request for a Parliament decision as to whether those privileges and immunities have been or are likely to be breached may be made in accordance with Rule 9 1 . 1 Regulation EC No 1049 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 43 . 2 Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 November 2002 between the European Parliament and the Council concerning access by the Euro pean Parliament to sensitive information of the Council in the field of security and defence policy OJ C 298, 30.11.2002, p. 1 . Framework Agreement of 20 October 2010 on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission OJ L 304, 20.11.2010, p. 47 . Interinstitutional Agreement of 12 March 2014 between the European Parliament and the Council concerning the forwarding to and handling by the European Parliament of classified information held by the Council on matters other than those in the area of the com mon foreign and security policy OJ C 95, 1.4.2014, p. 1 . 3 Decision of the European Parliament of 23 October 2002 on the implementation of the Interinstitutional Agreement governing Euro pean Parliament access to sensitive Council information in the sphere of security and defence policy OJ C 298, 30.11.2002, p. 4 . Decision of the Bureau of 15 April 2013 concerning the rules governing the treatment of confidential information by the European Parliament OJ C 96, 1.4.2014, p. 1 . L 302 14 EN Official Journal of the European Union 22.11.2019  2. In particular, such a request for the defence of privileges and immunities may be made if it is considered that the circumstances would constitute an administrative or other restriction on the free movement of Members travelling to or from the place of meeting of Parliament or an administrative or other restriction on an opinion expressed or a vote cast in the performance of their duties, or that the circumstances would fall within the scope of Article 9 of the Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union. 3. A request for the defence of the privileges and immunities of a Member shall not be admissible if a request for the waiver or defence of that Member s immunity has already been received in respect of the same facts, whether or not that earlier request led to a decision. 4. No further consideration shall be given to a request for the defence of the privileges and immunities of a Member if a request for the waiver of that Member s immunity is received in respect of the same facts. 5. In cases where a decision has been taken not to defend the privileges and immunities of a Member, the Member may exceptionally make a request for reconsideration of the decision, by submitting new evidence in accordance with Rule 9 1 . The request for reconsideration shall be inadmissible if proceedings have been instituted against the decision under Article 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or if the President considers that the new evidence submitted is insufficiently substantiated to warrant reconsideration. Rule 8 Urgent action by the President to assert immunity 1. As a matter of urgency, in circumstances where a Member is arrested or has his or her freedom of movement curtailed in apparent breach of his or her privileges and immunities, the President may, after consulting the Chair and rapporteur of the committee responsible, take an initiative to assert the privileges and immunities of the Member con cerned. The President shall notify the committee of that initiative and inform Parliament. 2. When the President makes use of the powers conferred on him or her by paragraph 1, the committee shall take cognisance of the President s initiative at its next meeting. Where the committee deems it necessary, it may prepare a report for submission to Parliament. Rule 9 Procedures on immunity 1. Any request addressed to the President by a competent authority of a Member State for the immunity of a Member to be waived, or by a Member or a former Member for privileges and immunities to be defended, shall be announced in Parliament and referred to the committee responsible. 2. With the agreement of the Member or the former Member concerned, the request may be made by another Member, who shall be permitted to represent the Member or former Member concerned at all stages of the procedure. The Member representing the Member or the former Member concerned shall not be involved in the decisions taken by the committee. 3. The committee shall consider, without delay but having regard to their relative complexity, requests for the waiver of immunity or requests for the defence of privileges and immunities. 4. The committee shall make a proposal for a reasoned decision which recommends the adoption or rejection of the request for the waiver of immunity or for the defence of privileges and immunities. Amendments shall not be admissi ble. If a proposal is rejected, the contrary decision shall be deemed to have been adopted. 5. The committee may ask the authority concerned to provide any information or explanation which the committee deems necessary in order for it to form an opinion on whether immunity should be waived or defended. 6. The Member concerned shall be given an opportunity to be heard and may present any documents or other written evidence deemed by that Member to be relevant. The Member concerned shall not be present during debates on the request for waiver or defence of his or her immunity, except for the hearing itself. 22.11.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 302 15  The Chair of the committee shall invite the Member to be heard, indicating a date and time. The Member concerned may renounce the right to be heard. If the Member concerned fails to attend the hearing pursuant to that invitation, he or she shall be deemed to have renounced the right to be heard, unless he or she has asked to be excused from being heard on the date and at the time proposed, and has given his or her reasons. The Chair of the committee shall rule on whether such a request to be excused is to be accepted in view of the reasons given. The Member concerned shall not be permitted to appeal that ruling. If the Chair of the committee grants the request to be excused, he or she shall invite the Member concerned to be heard at a new date and time. If the Member concerned fails to comply with the second invitation to be heard, the procedure shall continue without the Member being heard. No further requests to be excused, or to be heard, may then be accepted. 7. Where the request seeks the waiver or the defence of immunity on several counts, each of these may be the subject of a separate decision. The committee s report may, exceptionally, propose that the waiver or the defence of immunity should apply solely to prosecution proceedings and that, until a final sentence is passed, the Member should be immune from any form of detention or remand or any other measure which prevents that Member from performing the duties proper to the mandate. 8. The committee may offer a reasoned opinion as to the competence of the authority in question and the admissi bility of the request, but shall not, under any circumstances, pronounce on the guilt, or otherwise, of the Member, nor shall it pronounce on whether or not the opinions or acts attributed to the Member justify prosecution, even if the committee, in considering the request, acquires detailed knowledge of the facts of the case. 9. The committee s proposal for a decision shall be placed on the agenda of the first sitting following the day on which it was tabled. No amendments may be tabled to such a proposal. Discussion shall be confined to the reasons for and against each proposal to waive or uphold immunity, or to defend a privilege or immunity. Without prejudice to Rule 173, the Member whose privileges or immunities are under consideration shall not speak in the debate. The proposal or proposals for a decision contained in the report shall be put to the vote at the first voting time follow ing the debate. After Parliament has considered the matter, a separate vote shall be taken on each of the proposals contained in the report. If a proposal is rejected, the contrary decision shall be deemed to have been adopted. 10. The President shall immediately communicate Parliament s decision to the Member concerned and to the compe tent authority of the Member State concerned, with a request that the President be informed of any developments and judicial rulings in the relevant proceedings. When the President receives this information, he or she shall transmit it to Parliament in the way he or she considers most appropriate, if necessary after consulting the committee responsible. 11. The committee shall treat these matters, and handle any documents received with the utmost confidentiality. The committee shall always consider requests relating to procedures on immunity in camera. 12. Parliament shall only examine requests for the waiver of a Member s immunity that have been transmitted to it by the judicial authorities or by the Permanent Representations of the Member States. 13. The committee shall lay down principles for the application of this Rule. 14. Any inquiry as to the scope of Members privileges or immunities made by a competent authority shall be dealt with in accordance with the above rules. Rule 10 Standards of conduct 1.

Members shall not disrupt the good order of the Chamber and shall refrain from improper behaviour. They shall not display banners. 4. In parliamentary debates in the Chamber, Members shall not resort to offensive language. The assessment of whether the language used by a Member in a parliamentary debate is offensive or not should take into considera tion, inter alia, the identifiable intentions of the speaker, the perception of the statement by the public, the extent to which it harms the dignity and reputation of Parliament, and the freedom of speech of the Member concerned. By way of example, defamatory language, hate speech and incitement to discrimination based, in particular, on any ground referred to in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, would ordinarily constitute cases of offensive language within the meaning of this Rule. 5. Members shall comply with Parliament s rules on the treatment of confidential information. 6. Members shall refrain from any type of psychological or sexual harassment and shall respect the Code of appropri ate behaviour for Members of the European Parliament in exercising their duties which is attached to these Rules of Procedure as an annex 4 . Members may not be elected as office holders of Parliament or one of its bodies, be appointed as rapporteur or partici pate in an official delegation or interinstitutional negotiations, if they have not signed the declaration relating to that Code. 7. Where a person working for a Member, or another person for whom the Member has arranged access to Parlia ment s premises or equipment, fails to comply with the standards of conduct set out in this Rule, this behaviour may, where appropriate, be imputable to the Member concerned. 8. The application of this Rule shall not otherwise detract from the liveliness of parliamentary debates, nor shall it undermine Members freedom of speech. 9. This Rule shall apply, mutatis mutandis, in Parliament s bodies, committees and delegations. Rule 11 Members financial interests and Transparency register 1. Parliament shall lay down rules governing the transparency of its Members financial interests in the form of a Code of Conduct which shall be adopted by a majority of its component Members and attached to these Rules of Procedure as an annex 5 . Those rules shall not otherwise prejudice or restrict Members in the exercise of their office or of any related political or other activity. 2. Members should adopt the systematic practice of only meeting interest representatives that have registered in the Transparency Register established by means of the Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission 6 . 3. Members should publish online all scheduled meetings with interest representatives falling under the scope of the Transparency register. Without prejudice to Article 4 6 of Annex I, rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and committee chairs shall, for each report, publish online all scheduled meetings with interest representatives falling under the scope of the Transparency register. The Bureau shall provide for necessary infrastructure on Parliament s website. 4. The Bureau shall provide the necessary infrastructure on Members online page on Parliament s website for those Members who wish to publish a voluntary audit or confirmation, as provided for under the applicable rules of the Statute for Members and its implementing rules, that their use of the General Expenditure Allowance complies with the applicable rules of the Statute for Members and its implementing measures. 4 See Annex II. 5 See Annex I. 6 Agreement of 16 April 2014 between the European Parliament and the European Commission on the transparency register for organ isations and self employed individuals engaged in EU policy making and policy implementation OJ L 277, 19.9.2014, p. 11 . 22.11.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 302 17  5.

The Chair shall settle any disputes which may arise as a result of the application of this paragraph. 5. On a proposal from its Chair, the committee may set a deadline within which the rapporteur must submit the draft report. This deadline may be extended or a new rapporteur appointed. 6. Once the deadline has expired, the committee may instruct its Chair to ask for the matter that has been referred to it to be placed on the agenda of one of the next sittings of Parliament. The debates and votes may then be conducted on the basis of an oral report by the committee concerned. Rule 56 Opinions of committees 1. If the committee to which a matter was first referred wishes to hear the views of another committee, or if another committee wishes to make known its views to the committee to which a matter was first referred, such committees may ask the President in accordance with Rule 210 2 for one committee to be named as the committee responsible and the other as the opinion giving committee.

Rule 57 Associated committee procedure 1. Where a question of competence is referred to the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 211, and the Confer ence of Presidents, on the basis of Annex VI, considers that the matter falls almost equally within the competence of two or more committees, or that different parts of the matter fall within the competence of two or more committees, Rule 56 shall apply with the following additional provisions the timetable shall be jointly agreed by the committees concerned, the rapporteurs concerned shall keep each other informed and shall endeavour to agree on the texts they propose to their committees and on their position regarding amendments, the Chairs and rapporteurs concerned are bound by the principle of good and sincere cooperation they shall jointly identify areas of the text falling within their exclusive or shared competence and agree on the precise arrangements for their cooperation in the event of disagreement about the delimitation of competences the matter shall be sub mitted, at the request of one of the committees involved, to the Conference of Presidents the Conference of Presi dents may decide on the question of the respective competences or decide that the joint committee procedure under Rule 58 is to apply it shall take its decision in accordance with the procedure and within the deadline set out in Rule 211, the committee responsible shall accept without a vote amendments from an associated committee where they con cern matters which fall within the exclusive competence of that associated committee if the committee responsible fails to respect the exclusive competence of the associated committee, that associated committee may table amend ments directly in plenary if amendments on matters which fall within the shared competence of the committee responsible and an associated committee are not adopted by the committee responsible, the associated committee may table those amendments directly in plenary, in the event of a conciliation procedure in respect of the proposal, Parliament s delegation shall include the rappor teur of any associated committee. 22.11.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 302 33  A decision by the Conference of Presidents to apply the associated committee procedure applies at all stages of the procedure in question. The rights attaching to the status of committee responsible are exercised by the lead committee. In exercising those rights, the lead committee must take due account of the prerogatives of the associated committee. In particular, the lead committee must comply with the obligation to observe the principle of sincere cooperation as regards the timetable and respect the right of the associated commit tee to determine the amendments submitted in plenary which fall within its exclusive competence. 2. The procedure laid down in this Rule shall not apply to the recommendations to be adopted by the committee responsible under Rule 105. Rule 58 Joint committee procedure 1. When a question of competence is referred to it pursuant to Rule 211, the Conference of Presidents may decide that the procedure with joint meetings of committees and a joint vote is to be applied, provided that by virtue of Annex VI, the matter falls indissociably within the competences of several committees, and it is satisfied that the question is of major importance. 2. In that event, the respective rapporteurs shall draw up a single draft report, which shall be examined and voted on by the committees involved, under the joint chairmanship of the committee Chairs. At all stages of the procedure, the rights attaching to the status of committee responsible may be exercised by the com mittees involved only when they are acting jointly. The committees involved may set up working groups to prepare the meetings and votes. 3. At the second reading stage of the ordinary legislative procedure, the Council position shall be considered at a joint meeting of the committees involved, which, should no agreement be reached between their Chairs, shall be held on the Wednesday of the first week set aside for meetings of parliamentary bodies following the communication of the Council s position to Parliament. If no agreement is reached on the convening of a further meeting, any such meeting shall be convened by the Chair of the Conference of Committee Chairs. The vote on the recommendation for second reading shall be taken at a joint meeting on the basis of a joint text drafted by the respective rapporteurs of the com mittees involved or, in the absence of a joint text, on the basis of the amendments tabled in the committees involved. At the third reading stage of the ordinary legislative procedure, the Chairs and rapporteurs of the committees involved shall be members ex officio of the delegation to the Conciliation Committee. CHAPTER 3 Ordinary legislative procedure SECTION 1 FIRST READING Rule 59 Vote in Parliament first reading 1. Parliament may approve, amend or reject the draft legislative act. 2. Parliament shall first vote on any proposal for the immediate rejection of the draft legislative act that has been tabled in writing by the committee responsible, a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold. If that proposal for rejection is adopted, the President shall ask the originating institution to withdraw the draft legisla tive act. If the originating institution does so, the President shall declare the procedure closed. If the originating institution does not withdraw the draft legislative act, the President shall announce that the first read ing of Parliament is concluded, unless, on a proposal of the Chair or rapporteur of the committee responsible or of a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold, Parliament decides to refer the matter back to the committee responsible for reconsideration. L 302 34 EN Official Journal of the European Union 22.11.2019  If that proposal for rejection is not adopted, Parliament shall then proceed in accordance with paragraphs 3, 4 and 5. 3. Any provisional agreement tabled by the committee responsible under Rule 74 4 shall be given priority in voting and shall be put to a single vote, unless, at the request of a political group or Members reaching at least the low thresh old, Parliament decides instead to proceed with the vote on amendments in accordance with paragraph 4. In that case, Parliament shall also decide whether to hold the vote on the amendments immediately. If not, Parliament shall set a new deadline for amendments and the vote shall take place at a subsequent sitting. If, in that single vote, the provisional agreement is adopted, the President shall announce that the first reading of Parlia ment has been concluded. If, in that single vote, the provisional agreement fails to secure the majority of the votes cast, the President shall set a new deadline for amendments to the draft legislative act. Such amendments shall then be put to the vote at a subse quent sitting in order for Parliament to conclude its first reading. 4. Save where a proposal for rejection has been adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 or a provisional agreement has been adopted in accordance with paragraph 3, any amendments to the draft legislative act shall then be put to the vote, including, where applicable, individual parts of the provisional agreement where requests have been made for split or separate votes, or competing amendments have been tabled. Before Parliament votes on the amendments, the President may ask the Commission to state its position and the Council to comment. After it has voted on those amendments, Parliament shall vote on the whole draft legislative act, amended or otherwise. If the whole draft legislative act, amended or otherwise, is adopted, the President shall announce that the first reading has been concluded, unless, on a proposal of the Chair or the rapporteur of the committee responsible or of a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold, Parliament decides to refer the matter back to the committee responsible, for interinstitutional negotiations in accordance with Rules 60 and 74. If the whole draft legislative act, as amended or otherwise, fails to secure a majority of the votes cast, the President shall announce that the first reading has been concluded, unless, on a proposal of the Chair or rapporteur of the committee responsible or of a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold, Parliament decides to refer the matter back to the committee responsible for reconsideration. 5. After the votes taken under paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, and the votes subsequently taken on amendments to the draft legislative resolution relating to procedural requests, if any, the legislative resolution shall be deemed to have been adopted. If necessary, the legislative resolution shall be modified pursuant to Rule 203 2 , in order to reflect the out come of the votes taken under paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. The text of the legislative resolution and of Parliament s position shall be forwarded, by the President, to the Council and the Commission, as well as, where the draft legislative act originates from them, to the originating group of Mem ber States, the Court of Justice or the European Central Bank. Rule 60 Referral back to the committee responsible If, in accordance with Rule 59, a matter is referred back to the committee responsible for reconsideration or for interin stitutional negotiations in accordance with Rule 74, the committee responsible shall, orally or in writing, report to Par liament within four months. That period may be extended by the Conference of Presidents. Following a referral back to committee, the lead committee must, before taking a decision on the procedure to be followed, allow an associated committee, as Rule 57 provides, to make choices as to the amendments which fall within its exclusive competence, and in particular to choose which amendments are to be resubmitted in plenary. Nothing prevents Parliament from deciding to hold, if appropriate, a concluding debate following the report by the committee responsible, to which the matter was referred back. 22.11.2019 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 302 35  Rule 61 Renewed referral to Parliament 1. The President shall, at the request of the committee responsible, ask the Commission to refer its proposal again to Parliament where the Commission replaces, substantially amends or intends to substantially amend its initial proposal after Parliament has adopted its position, except where this is done in order to take account of Parliament s position, the nature of the problem with which the proposal is concerned substantially changes as a result of the passage of time or changes in circumstances, or new elections to Parliament have taken place since it adopted its position, and the Conference of Presidents consid ers it desirable. 2. If a modification of the legal basis of a proposal is envisaged which would result in the ordinary legislative proce dure no longer applying to that proposal, the Parliament, Council and Commission will, pursuant to paragraph 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law Making, acting through their respective Presidents or their representa tives, exchange views thereon. 3. Following the exchange of views referred to in paragraph 2, the President shall, at the request of the committee responsible, ask the Council to refer the draft legally binding act to Parliament again, where the Commission or the Council intends to modify the legal basis provided for in Parliament s position at first reading, with the result that the ordinary legislative procedure would no longer apply. Rule 62 First reading agreement Where, in accordance with Article 294 4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Council has informed Parliament that it has approved Parliament s position, the President, following finalisation in accordance with Rule 203, shall announce in Parliament that the legislative act has been adopted in the wording which corresponds to the position of Parliament. SECTION 2 SECOND READING Rule 63 Communication of the Council s position 1. Communication of the Council s position pursuant to Article 294 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Euro pean Union takes place when it is announced by the President in Parliament. The President shall make the announce ment after receiving the documents which contain the position itself, all declarations made in the Council minutes when it adopted the position, the reasons which led the Council to adopt its position, and the Commission s position, duly translated into the official languages of the European Union. The President s announcement shall be made during the part session following the receipt of those documents. Before making the announcement, the President establishes, after consulting the Chair of the committee responsible, or the rappor teur, or both of them, that the text received is indeed Council s first reading position and that the circumstances described in Rule 61 do not apply. Failing this, the President, together with the committee responsible and, where possible, in agreement with the Council, seeks an appropriate solution. 2. On the day of its announcement in Parliament, the Council s position shall be deemed to have been referred auto matically to the committee responsible at first reading. 3. A list of such communications shall be published in the minutes of the sitting together with the names of the committees responsible. Rule 64 Extension of time limits 1. The President shall, at the request of the Chair of the committee responsible, extend the time limits for second reading in accordance with Article 294 14 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. L 302 36 EN Official Journal of the European Union 22.11.2019  2. The President shall notify Parliament of any extension of time limits under Article 294 14 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, whether such extensions occur at the initiative of Parliament or of the Council. Rule 65 Procedure in the committee responsible 1.

If an objection is raised, Parliament shall decide on the matter by a majority of the votes cast. 35 Rule 181 applies mutatis mutandis to committees see Rule 219 . L 302 80 EN Official Journal of the European Union 22.11.2019  Rule 182 Voting procedure 36 1.

Amendments shall have priority over the text to which they relate and shall be put to the vote before that text. 2. If two or more mutually exclusive amendments have been tabled to the same part of a text, the amendment that departs furthest from the original text shall have priority and shall be put to the vote first. If it is adopted, the other amendments shall be deemed to have been rejected if it is rejected, the amendment next in priority shall be put to the vote, and this procedure shall be repeated for each of the remaining amendments. Where there is a doubt as to priority, the President shall decide. If all amendments are rejected, the original text shall be deemed to have been adopted unless a separate vote has been requested within the deadline specified. 3. However, where the President considers that this will facilitate the vote, he or she may put the original text to the vote first, or put an amendment that is closer to the original text to the vote before the amendment that departs fur thest from the original text. If either of these secures a majority, all other amendments tabled to the same part of the text shall fall. 4. Where compromise amendments are put to the vote, they shall be given priority in voting. 5. A split vote shall not be admissible in the case of a vote on a compromise amendment. 6.

Where two or more identical amendments are tabled by different authors, they shall be put to the vote as one. 10. Amendments in respect of which a roll call vote has been requested shall be put to the vote separately from other amendments. Rule 184 Committee filter of plenary amendments When more than 50 amendments or requests for a split or separate vote have been tabled concerning a text tabled by a committee for consideration in Parliament, the President may, after consulting its Chair, ask that committee to meet to vote on each of those amendments or requests.

In all other cases where there is a tied vote, without prejudice to those Rules which require qualified majorities, the text or proposal shall be deemed to have been rejected. Rule 189 3 is to be interpreted as meaning that, where there is a tied vote on a draft recommendation under Rule 149 4 not to intervene in proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union, such a tie does not signify the adoption of a recommen dation according to which Parliament should intervene in those proceedings. In such a case, the committee responsible is to be deemed not to have expressed any recommendation. The President may vote, but shall not have a casting vote. Rule 190 Voting by roll call 42 1.

Parliament, on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents, shall decide whether to set up a committee and, if so, its numerical strength. 5. Committees of inquiry shall not have the right to deliver opinions to other committees. 6. At any stage of its proceedings, only full members or, in their absence, substitutes may vote in a committee of inquiry. 7.

With regard to the languages used, a committee of inquiry shall apply the provisions of Rule 167. However, the bureau of the committee may restrict interpretation to the official languages of those members of the committee taking part in the delibera tions, if it deems this to be necessary for reasons of confidentiality, shall decide about the translation of the documents received in such a way as to ensure that the committee can carry out its deliberations efficiently and rapidly, as well as to ensure that the necessary secrecy and confidentiality are respected. 10. Where alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Union law suggest that a body or authority of a Member State could be responsible, the committee of inquiry may ask the parliament of the Member State concerned to cooperate in the investigation. 11. A committee of inquiry shall conclude its work by presenting to Parliament a report on the results of its work within no more than 12 months from its constitutive meeting.

The Chair of the committee shall be notified at the latest by the beginning of the voting session. The advance notification provided for in the last sentence of paragraph 7 must be given before the end of the debate or before the opening of the vote on the item or items for which the full member is to be replaced. In accordance with this Rule the status of a full or substitute member of a committee shall depend exclusively on membership of a given political group, if the number of a political group s full members in a committee changes, the maximum number of permanent substitutes which it can appoint to that committee shall change accordingly, Members who change their political group may not keep the status of full or substitute member of a committee which they had as members of their original group, a committee member may not under any circumstances be a substitute for a colleague who belongs to another political group.

The Conference of Presidents shall take a decision within six weeks after the submission of the question on the basis of a recommendation from the Conference of Committee Chairs, or, if no such recommendation is forthcoming, from the latter s Chair. If the Conference of Presidents fails to take a decision within that period, the recommendation shall be deemed to have been approved. 3. The committee Chairs may enter into agreements with other committee Chairs concerning the allocation of an item to a particular committee, subject, where necessary, to the authorisation of an associated committee procedure under Rule 57. Rule 212 Subcommittees 1. Subcommittees may be set up in accordance with Rule 206.

Where the number of nominations corresponds to the number of seats to be filled, the election shall take place by acclamation. However, if there is more than one candidate on a given ballot, or members or a political group or groups reaching at least the high threshold in the committee requested a vote, the election shall take place by secret ballot. If there is only one candidate, the election shall be by an absolute majority of the votes cast, for and against. If there is more than one candidate, the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of the votes cast at the first ballot shall be elected.

The Vice Chairs may be invited to participate in the meetings of committee coordinators in a consultative role. When consensus cannot be attained, the coordinators may only act by a majority that clearly represents a large majority of the committee, having regard to the respective strengths of the various political groups. The Chair shall announce in committee all decisions and recommendations of the coordinators, which shall be deemed to have been adopted if they have not been contested. They shall be duly mentioned in the minutes of the committee meeting. Non attached Members do not constitute a political group within the meaning of Rule 33 and they cannot therefore designate coordinators, who are the only Members entitled to attend coordinator meetings. In all cases, non attached Members must be guaranteed access to information, in accordance with the principle of non discrimina tion, through the supply of information and the presence of a member of the non attached Members secretariat at coordinator meetings.
