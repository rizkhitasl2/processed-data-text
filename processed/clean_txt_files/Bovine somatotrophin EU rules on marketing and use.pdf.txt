EN Official Journal of the European Communities 23. 12. 1999 L 331 72 8 The Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare SCAWAH adopted on 10 March 1999 its report on Animal Welfare Aspects of the Use of bovine somatotrophin and stated that BST increases the risk of clinical mastitis as well as the duration of treatment of mastitis, that it increases the incidence of foot and leg disorders and that it can affect adversely reproduction as well as induce severe reactions at the injection site 9 It is important for the health and productivity of dairy cattle that they are subjected to minimum stress which may lead to increase in diseases such as mastitis, foot lesions and reactions to injection site according to the opinion of the SCAWAH, the use of BST has been shown to lead to increases in these conditions, which are both painful and debilitating, and which can lead to poorer welfare and greater animal morbidity. The SCAHAW considers therefore that BST is not to be used in dairy cows, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION Article 1 From the time this Decision takes effect, Member States shall ensure that the placing on the market of bovine somatotrophin on Community territory or within their jurisdiction for the purpose of its marketing and administration thereof to dairy cows by any means whatsoever shall be prohibited.

The above information must be made available to the competent authority at its request and, in the case of computerized records, in the form of a printout. Article 3 The prohibition provided for in Article 1 shall not affect the production of bovine somatotrophin in the Member States, or imports, for the purposes of its export to third countries. Article 4 Decision 90 218 EEC shall be repealed. Article 5 This Decision shall take effect as from 1 January 2000. Article 6 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
