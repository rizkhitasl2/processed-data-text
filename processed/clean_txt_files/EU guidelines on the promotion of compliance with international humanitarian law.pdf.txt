IV Notices NOTICES FROM EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS AND BODIES COUNCIL Updated European Union Guidelines on promoting compliance with international humanitarian law IHL 2009 C 303 06 I. PURPOSE 1. The purpose of these Guidelines is to set out operational tools for the European Union and its institutions and bodies to promote compliance with international humani tarian law IHL . They underline the European Union s commitment to promote such compliance in a visible and consistent manner. The Guidelines are addressed to all those taking action within the framework of the European Union to the extent that the matters raised fall within their areas of responsibility and competence. They are complementary to Guidelines and other Common Positions already adopted within the EU in relation to matters such as human rights, torture and the protection of civilians 1 . 2. These Guidelines are in line with the commitment of the EU and its Member States to IHL, and aim to address compliance with IHL by third States, and, as appropriate, non State actors operating in third States. Whilst the same commitment extends to measures taken by the EU and its Member States to ensure compliance with IHL in their own conduct, including by their own forces, such measures are not covered by these Guidelines 2 . II. INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW IHL Introduction 3. The European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. This includes the goal of promoting compliance with IHL. 4. International Humanitarian Law IHL also known as the Law of Armed Conflict or the Law of War is intended to alleviate the effects of armed conflict by protecting those not, or no longer taking part in conflict and by regulating the means and methods of warfare. 5. States are obliged to comply with the rules of IHL to which they are bound by treaty or which form part of customary international law. They may also apply to non State actors. Such compliance is a matter of international concern. In addition, the suffering and destruction caused by violations of IHL render post conflict settlements more difficult. There is therefore a political, as well as a humanitarian interest, in improving compliance with IHL throughout the world. Evolution and Sources of IHL 6. The rules of IHL have evolved as a result of balancing military necessity and humanitarian concerns. IHL comprises rules that seek to protect persons who are not, or are no longer, taking direct part in hostilities such as civilians, prisoners of war and other detainees, and the injured and sick as well as to restrict the means EN C 303 12 Official Journal of the European Union 15.12.2009 1 See EU Guidelines on Human Rights Dialogues approved by the Council on 13 December 2001, updated on 19 January 2009 Guidelines for EU Policy towards Third Countries on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Punishment or Treatment approved by the Council on 9 April 2001, updated on 29 April 2008 EU Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflict approved by the Council on 8 December 2003, updated on 17 June 2008 EU Guidelines on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child approved by the Council on 10 December 2007 Guidelines on Violence against women and girls combating all forms of discrimination against them approved by the Council on 8 December 2008 and Council Common Position 2003 444 CFSP of 16 June 2003 on the ICC OJ L 150, 18.6.2003, p. 67 . 2 All EU Member States are Parties to the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols and thus under the obligation to abide by their rules.  and methods of warfare including tactics and weaponry in order to avoid unnecessary suffering and destruction. 7. As with other parts of international law, IHL has two main sources international conventions treaties and customary international law. Customary international law is formed by the practice of States, which they accept as binding upon them. Judicial decisions and writings of leading authors are subsidiary means for determining the law. 8. The principal IHL Conventions are listed in the Annex to these Guidelines. The most important are the 1907 Hague Regulations, the four Geneva Conventions from 1949 and their 1977 Additional Protocols. The Hague Regulation and most of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocols are generally recognised as customary law. Scope of application 9. IHL is applicable to any armed conflicts, both international and non international and irrespective of the origin of the conflict. It also applies to situations of occupation arising from an armed conflict. Different legal regimes apply to international armed conflicts, which are between States, and non international or internal armed conflicts, which take place within a State. 10. Whether situation amounts to an armed conflict and whether it is an international or non international armed conflict are mixed questions of fact and law, the answers to which depend on a range of factors. Appropriate legal advice, together with sufficient information about the particular context, should always be sought in determining whether a situation amounts to an armed conflict, and thus whether international humanitarian law is applicable. 11. The treaty provisions on international armed conflicts are more detailed and extensive. Non international armed conflicts are subject to the provisions in Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and, where the State concerned is a Party, in the 1977 Additional Protocol II. Rules of customary international law apply to both international and internal armed conflicts but again there are differences between the two regimes. International Human Rights Law and IHL 12. It is important to distinguish between international human rights law and IHL. They are distinct bodies of law and, while both are principally aimed at protecting individuals, there are important differences between them. In particular, IHL is applicable in time of armed conflict and occupation. Conversely, human rights law is applicable to everyone within the jurisdiction of the State concerned in time of peace as well as in time of armed conflict. Thus while distinct, the two sets of rules may both be applicable to a particular situation and it is therefore sometimes necessary to consider the relationship between them. However, these Guidelines do not deal with human rights law. Individual responsibility 13. Certain serious violations of IHL are defined as war crimes. War crimes may occur in the same circumstances as genocide and crimes against humanity but the latter, unlike war crimes, are not linked to the existence of an armed conflict. 14. Individuals bear personal responsibility for war crimes. States must, in accordance with their national law, ensure that alleged perpetrators are brought before their own domestic courts or handed over for trial by the courts of another State or by an international criminal tribunal, such as the international Criminal Court 3 . III. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES A. REPORTING, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION 15. Action under this heading includes a In order to enable effective action, situations where IHL may apply must be identified without delay. The responsible EU bodies, including appropriate Council Working Groups, should monitor situations within their areas of responsibility where IHL may be applicable, drawing on advice, as necessary, regarding IHL and its applicability. Where appropriate they should identify and recommend action to promote compliance with IHL in accordance with these Guidelines. Consul tations and exchange of information with knowl edgeable actors, including the ICRC and other relevant organisations such as the UN and regional organi sations, should be considered when appropriate. EN 15.12.2009 Official Journal of the European Union C 303 13 3 See the Union s Common Position on the ICC 2003 444 CFSP and the EU s Action Plan on the ICC. See further Decision of 13 June 2002 2002 494 JHA by which the Council set up a European network of contact points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes the Framework Decision 2002 584 JHA on the European arrest warrant and the procedures between Member States the Decision of 8 May 2003 2003 335 JHA concerning the investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes Council Decision 2006 313 CFSP of 10 April 2006 concerning the conclusion of the Agreement between the International Criminal Court and the European Union on cooperation and assistance, OJ L 115, 28.4.2006, p. 49.  Consideration should also be given, where appropriate, to drawing on the services of the International Humani tarian Fact Finding Commission IHFFC established under Article 90 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which can assist in promoting respect for IHL through its fact finding capacity and its good offices function. b Whenever relevant, EU Heads of Mission, and appro priate EU representatives, including Heads of EU Civilian Operations, Commanders of EU Military Operations and EU Special Representatives, should include an assessment of the IHL situation in their reports about a given State or conflict. Special attention should be given to information that indicates that serious violations of IHL may have been committed. Where feasible, such reports should also include an analysis and suggestions of possible measures to be taken by the EU. c Background papers for EU meetings should include, where appropriate, an analysis on the applicability of IHL and Member States participating in such meetings should also ensure that they are able to draw on advice as necessary on IHL issues arising. In a situation where an armed conflict may be at hand, the Council Working Group on International Law COJUR should be informed along with other relevant Working Groups. If appropriate and feasible, COJUR could be tasked to make suggestions of future EU action to relevant EU bodies. B. MEANS OF ACTION AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE EU IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES 16. The EU has a variety of means of action at its disposal. These include, but are not limited to, the following a Political dialogue Where relevant the issue of compliance with IHL should be brought up in dialogues with third States. This is particularly important in the context of on going armed conflicts where there have been reports of widespread IHL violations. However, the EU should also, in peace time, call upon States that have not yet done so to adhere to, and fully implement, important IHL instruments, such as the 1977 Additional Protocols and the ICC Statute. Full implementation includes enactment of any necessary implementing legislation and training of relevant personnel in IHL. b General public statements In public statements on issues related to IHL, the EU should, whenever appro priate, emphasise the need to ensure compliance with IHL. c Demarches and or public statements about specific conflicts When violations of IHL are reported the EU should consider making demarches and issuing public statements, as appropriate, condemning such acts and demanding that the parties fulfil their obligations under IHL and undertake effective measures to prevent further violations. d Restrictive measures sanctions The use of restrictive measures sanctions may be an effective means of promoting compliance with IHL. Such measures should therefore be considered against State and non State parties to a conflict, as well as individuals, when they are appropriate and in accordance with inter national law. e Cooperation with other international bodies Where appropriate, the EU should cooperate with the UN and relevant regional organisations for the promotion of compliance with IHL. EU Member States should also, whenever appropriate, act towards that goal as members in other organisations, including the United Nations. The International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC has a treaty based, recognised and long estab lished role as a neutral, independent humanitarian organisation, in promoting compliance with IHL. f Crisis management operations The importance of preventing and suppressing violations of IHL by third parties should be considered, where appropriate, in the drafting of mandates of EU crisis management operations. In appropriate cases, this may include collecting information which may be of use for the ICC 4 or in other investigations of war crimes. g Individual responsibility While, in post conflict situations it is sometimes difficult to balance the overall aim of establishing peace and the need to combat impunity, the European Union should ensure that there is no impunity for war crimes. To have a deterrent effect during an armed conflict the pros ecution of war crimes must be visible, and should, if possible, take place in the State were the violations have occurred. The EU should therefore encourage third States to enact national penal legislation to punish violations of IHL. The EU s support of the ICC and measures to prosecute war criminals should also be seen in this context. EN C 303 14 Official Journal of the European Union 15.12.2009 4 See the Agreement on Cooperation and Assistance between the European Union and the International Criminal Court referred to in footnote 3 above.   h Training Training in IHL is necessary to ensure compliance with IHL in time of armed conflict. Training and education must also be undertaken in peacetime. This applies to the whole population, although special attention should be given to relevant groups such as law enforcement officials. Additional obligations apply to the training of military personnel. The EU should consider providing or funding training and education in IHL in third countries including within the framework of wider programmes to promote the rule of law. i Export of arms The Council Common Position 2008 944 CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment 5 provides that an importing country s compliance with IHL should be considered before licences to export to that country are granted. EN 15.12.2009 Official Journal of the European Union C 303 15 5 Council Common Position 2008 944 CFSP of 8 December 2008 defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment, OJ L 335, 13.12.2008, p. 99. This Common Position replaces the European Code of Conduct on Arms Exports adopted by the Council on 8 June 1998.
