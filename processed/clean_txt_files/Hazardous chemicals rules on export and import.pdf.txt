REGULATION EU No 649 2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 4 July 2012 concerning the export and import of hazardous chemicals recast Text with EEA relevance THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192 1 and Article 207 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 , After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 2 , Whereas 1 Regulation EC No 689 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemi cals 3 has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, Regulation EC No 689 2008 should be recast in the interest of clarity. 2 Regulation EC No 689 2008 implements the Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in inter national trade 4 the Convention , which entered into force on 24 February 2004, and replaces Regulation EC No 304 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals 5 . 3 For reasons of clarity and consistency with other relevant Union legislation, certain definitions should be introduced or clarified and terminology should be aligned with that used in Regulation EC No 1907 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authori sation and Restriction of Chemicals REACH and estab lishing a European Chemicals Agency 6 , on the one hand, and Regulation EC No 1272 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures 7 on the other hand. It is appropriate to ensure that this Regulation reflects the transitional provisions of Regulation EC No 1272 2008, in order to avoid any inconsistencies between the timetable of application of that Regulation and this Regu lation. 4 The Convention allows Parties the right to take action that is more stringently protective of human health and the environment than that called for in the Convention, provided that such action is consistent with the provisions of the Convention and is in accordance with international law. It is necessary and appropriate, in order to ensure a higher level of protection of the environment and the general public of importing countries, to go further than the provisions of the Convention in certain respects. 5 As regards the participation of the Union in the Convention, it is essential to have a single contact point for Union interaction with the Secretariat of the Convention the Secretariat and other Parties to the Convention as well as with other countries. The Commission should act as that contact point. 6 There is a need to ensure the effective coordination and management of technical and administrative aspects of this Regulation at Union level. The Member States and the European Chemicals Agency established by Regu lation EC No 1907 2006 the Agency have the competence and experience in implementing Union legis lation on chemicals and international agreements on chemicals. The Member States and the Agency should, therefore, carry out tasks with regard to the adminis trative, technical and scientific aspects of the implemen tation of the Convention through this Regulation, as well as the exchange of information. In addition, the Commission, the Member States and the Agency should cooperate in order to implement the Union s international obligations under the Convention effec tively. EN L 201 60 Official Journal of the European Union 27.7.2012 1 OJ C 318, 29.10.2011, p. 163. 2 Position of the European Parliament of 10 May 2012 not yet published in the Official Journal and decision of the Council of 26 June 2012. 3 OJ L 204, 31.7.2008, p. 1. 4 OJ L 63, 6.3.2003, p. 29. 5 OJ L 63, 6.3.2003, p. 1. 6 OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1. 7 OJ L 353, 31.12.2008, p. 1.   7 Given that certain tasks of the Commission should be transferred to the Agency, the European Database on Export and Import of Dangerous Chemicals initially established by the Commission should be further developed and maintained by the Agency. 8 Exports of hazardous chemicals that are banned or severely restricted within the Union should continue to be subject to a common export notification procedure. Accordingly, hazardous chemicals, whether in the form of substances on their own or in mixtures or in articles, which have been banned or severely restricted by the Union as plant protection products, as other forms of pesticides, or as industrial chemicals for use by profes sional users or by the public, should be subject to export notification rules similar to those applicable to such chemicals when they are banned or severely restricted within either or both of the use categories laid down in the Convention, namely as pesticides or chemicals for industrial use. In addition, chemicals subject to the international prior informed consent PIC procedure the PIC procedure should also be subject to the same export notification rules. That common export notifi cation procedure should apply to Union exports to all third countries, whether or not they are Parties to the Convention or participate in its procedures. Member States should be permitted to charge administrative fees, in order to cover their costs in carrying out this procedure. 9 Exporters and importers should be obliged to provide information concerning the quantities of chemicals in international trade covered by this Regulation so that the impact and effectiveness of the arrangements laid down therein can be monitored and assessed. 10 Notifications to the Secretariat of Union or Member State final regulatory actions banning or severely restricting chemicals, with a view to their inclusion in the PIC procedure, should be submitted by the Commission in cases where the criteria laid down in the Convention in this regard are met. Additional information to support such notifications should be sought where necessary. 11 In cases where Union or Member State final regulatory actions do not qualify for notification because they do not meet the criteria laid down in the Convention, information concerning the actions should nevertheless be conveyed to the Secretariat and other Parties to the Convention in the interests of exchange of information. 12 It is also necessary to ensure that the Union takes decisions with regard to the import into the Union of chemicals that are subject to the PIC procedure. These decisions should be based on applicable Union legislation and take into account bans or severe restrictions imposed by Member States. Where justified, amendments to Union legislation should be proposed. 13 Arrangements are needed to ensure that Member States and exporters are aware of the decisions of importing countries as regards chemicals that are subject to the PIC procedure, and that exporters comply with those decisions. Furthermore, in order to prevent undesired exports, no chemicals banned or severely restricted within the Union that meet the criteria for notification under the Convention or that are subject to the PIC procedure should be exported unless the explicit consent of the importing country concerned has been sought and obtained, whether or not that country is a Party to the Convention. At the same time, an exemption from this obligation is appropriate in relation to exports of certain chemicals to countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Devel opment OECD provided that certain conditions are met. Furthermore, a procedure is needed to deal with cases in which, despite all reasonable efforts, no response is obtained from the importing country, so that exports of certain chemicals may proceed on a temporary basis under specified conditions. It is also necessary to provide for periodic review of all such cases as well as those in which explicit consent is obtained. 14 It is also important that all chemicals exported have an adequate shelf life so that they may be used effectively and safely. As regards pesticides, in particular those exported to developing countries, it is essential that information about appropriate storage conditions be provided and that suitable packaging and sizes of containers be used to avoid creating obsolete stocks. 15 Articles containing chemicals do not fall within the scope of the Convention. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate that articles, as defined in this Regulation, containing chemicals that could be released under certain conditions of use or disposal and that are banned or severely restricted in the Union within one or more of the use categories laid down in the Convention or are subject to the PIC procedure should also be subject to the export notification rules. Furthermore, certain chemicals and articles containing specific chemicals falling outside the scope of the Convention but giving rise to particular concern should not be exported at all. 16 In accordance with the Convention, information on transit movements of chemicals subject to the PIC procedure should be provided to Parties to the Convention who request such information. 17 Union rules on packaging and labelling and other safety information should apply to all chemicals when intended for export to Parties and other countries unless those provisions would conflict with any specific requirements of those countries, taking into account relevant inter national standards. Since Regulation EC No 1272 2008 established new provisions on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, a reference to that Regulation should be included in this Regulation. EN 27.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 201 61   18 In order to ensure effective control and enforcement, Member States should designate authorities such as customs authorities that should have the responsibility of controlling imports and exports of chemicals covered by this Regulation. The Commission, supported by the Agency, and the Member States have a key role to play and should act in a targeted and coordinated way. Member States should provide for appropriate penalties in the event of infringements. 19 In order to facilitate customs control and to reduce the administrative burden for both exporters and authorities, a system of codes to be used in export declarations should be established. Special codes should also be used, as appropriate, for chemicals exported for the purpose of research or analysis in quantities that are unlikely to affect human health or the environment and that in any event do not exceed 10 kg from each exporter to each importing country per calendar year. 20 Exchange of information, shared responsibility and cooperative efforts between the Union and the Member States and third countries should be promoted with a view to ensuring sound management of chemicals, whether or not those third countries are Parties to the Convention. In particular, technical assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition should be provided directly by the Commission and the Member States, or indirectly via support for projects by non governmental organisations, especially assistance seeking to enable those countries to implement the Convention, thereby contributing to the prevention of harmful effects of chemicals on human health and the environment. 21 There should be regular monitoring of the operation of the procedures if they are to be effective. To this end, Member States and the Agency should regularly submit reports in standardised form to the Commission, which should in turn regularly report to the European Parliament and the Council. 22 Technical notes for guidance should be drawn up by the Agency to assist the designated authorities, including such authorities as customs authorities controlling exports, exporters and importers, in the application of this Regulation. 23 In order to adapt this Regulation to technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of inclusion of chemicals in Part 1 or 2 of Annex I and other amendments to that Annex, inclusion of chemicals in Part 1 or 2 of Annex V and other amendments to that Annex, and amendments to Annexes II, III, IV and VI. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. 24 In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implemen tation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation EU No 182 2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission s exercise of implementing powers 1 . 25 Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to ensure coherent and effective implementation of the Union s obligations under the Convention, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the necessity to harmonise the rules concerning imports and exports of hazardous chemicals, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. 26 Regulation EC No 689 2008 should be repealed. 27 It is appropriate to provide for the deferred application of this Regulation so as to allow the Agency sufficient time to prepare for its new role and allowing industry to familiarise itself with the new procedures, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION Article 1 Objectives 1. The objectives of this Regulation are to a implement the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade the Con vention b promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts in the international movement of hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm c contribute to the environmentally sound use of hazardous chemicals. EN L 201 62 Official Journal of the European Union 27.7.2012 1 OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13.  The objectives set out in the first subparagraph shall be achieved by facilitating the exchange of information concerning the char acteristics of hazardous chemicals, by providing for a decision making process within the Union on their import and export and by disseminating decisions to Parties and other countries as appropriate. 2. In addition to the objectives set out in paragraph 1, this Regulation shall ensure that the provisions of Regulation EC No 1272 2008 relating to classification, labelling and packaging apply to all chemicals when they are exported from the Member States to other Parties or other countries, unless those provisions would conflict with any specific requirements of those Parties or other countries. Article 2 Scope 1.

Chemicals listed in Annex I shall be assigned to one or more of three groups of chemicals, set out as Parts 1, 2 and 3 of that Annex. The chemicals listed in Part 1 of Annex I shall be subject to the export notification procedure laid down in Article 8, with detailed information being given on the identity of the substance, on the use category and or subcategory subject to restriction, the type of restriction and, where appropriate, additional information, in particular on exemptions to requirements for export notification. The chemicals listed in Part 2 of Annex I shall, in addition to being subject to the export notification procedure laid down in Article 8, qualify for the PIC notification procedure set out in Article 11, with detailed information being given on the identity of the substance and on the use category. The chemicals listed in Part 3 of Annex I shall be subject to the PIC procedure with the use category being given and, where appropriate, additional information, in particular on any requirements for export notification. 3. The lists set out in Annex I shall be made publicly available by means of the Database. EN L 201 66 Official Journal of the European Union 27.7.2012  Article 8 Export notifications forwarded to Parties and other countries 1. In the case of substances listed in Part 1 of Annex I or mixtures containing such substances in a concentration that triggers labelling obligations under Regulation EC No 1272 2008 irrespective of the presence of any other substances, paragraphs 2 to 8 of this Article shall apply regardless of the intended use of the chemical in the importing Party or other country. 2. When an exporter is due to export a chemical referred to in paragraph 1 from the Union to a Party or other country for the first time on or after the date on which it becomes subject to this Regulation, the exporter shall notify the designated national authority of the Member State in which he is estab lished the exporter s Member State , no later than 35 days before the expected date of export. Thereafter the exporter shall notify that designated national authority of the first export of the chemical each calendar year no later than 35 days before the export takes place. The notifications shall comply with the information requirements laid down in Annex II and shall be made available to the Commission and to the Member States by means of the Database. The designated national authority of the exporter s Member State shall check compliance of the information with Annex II and if the notification is complete forward it to the Agency no later than 25 days before the expected date of export. The Agency shall, on behalf of the Commission, transmit the notification to the designated national authority of the importing Party or the appropriate authority of the importing other country and take the measures necessary to ensure that they receive that notification no later than 15 days before the first intended export of the chemical and thereafter no later than 15 days before the first export in any subsequent calendar year. The Agency shall register each export notification and assign it a reference identification number in the Database. The Agency shall also make available to the public and the designated national authorities of the Member States, as appropriate, an updated list of the chemicals concerned and the importing Parties and other countries for each calendar year by means of the Database. 3. If the Agency does not receive from the importing Party or other country an acknowledgement of receipt of the first export notification made after the chemical is included in Part 1 of Annex I within 30 days of the dispatch of such notifi cation, it shall, on behalf of the Commission, submit a second notification. The Agency shall, on behalf of the Commission, make reasonable efforts to ensure that the designated national authority of the importing Party or the appropriate authority of the importing other country receives the second notification. 4. A new export notification shall be made in accordance with paragraph 2 for exports which take place subsequent to the entry into force of amendments to Union legislation concerning the marketing, use or labelling of the substances in question or whenever the composition of the mixture in question changes so that the labelling of such mixture is altered. The new notification shall comply with the information requirements laid down in Annex II and shall indicate that it is a revision of a previous notification. 5. Where the export of a chemical relates to an emergency situation in which any delay may endanger public health or the environment in the importing Party or other country, an exemption from the obligations set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 in whole or in part may be granted at the reasoned request of the exporter or the importing Party or other country and at the discretion of the designated national authority of the exporter s Member State, in consultation with the Commission assisted by the Agency. A decision on the request shall be considered to have been made in consultation with the Commission if there is no dissenting response from the Commission within 10 days of the designated national authority of the Member State sending it details of the request. 6. Without prejudice to the obligations set out in Article 19 2 , the obligations set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article shall cease when all of the following conditions are fulfilled a the chemical has become a chemical subject to the PIC procedure b the importing country is a Party to the Convention and has provided the Secretariat with a response in accordance with Article 10 2 of the Convention indicating whether or not it consents to import of the chemical and c the Commission has been informed of that response by the Secretariat and has forwarded that information to the Member States and the Agency. Notwithstanding the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the obligations set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article shall not cease where an importing country is a Party to the Convention and explicitly requires continued export notification by exporting Parties, for example through its import decision or otherwise. Without prejudice to the obligations set out in Article 19 2 , the obligations set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article shall also cease when both of the following conditions are fulfilled a the designated national authority of the importing Party or the appropriate authority of the importing other country has waived the requirement to be notified before the export of the chemical and EN 27.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union L 201 67   b the Commission has received the information from the Secretariat or from the designated national authority of the importing Party or the appropriate authority of the importing other country and has forwarded it to the Member States and the Agency, which has made it available by means of the Database. 7. The Commission, the relevant designated national auth orities of the Member States, the Agency and the exporters shall, on request, provide importing Parties and other countries with available additional information concerning the exported chemicals. 8. Member States may establish, in a transparent manner, systems obliging exporters to pay an administrative fee for each export notification made and for each request for explicit consent made, corresponding to the costs they incur in carrying out the procedures set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of this Article and in Article 14 6 and 7 . Article 9 Export notifications received from Parties and other countries 1. Export notifications received by the Agency from the designated national authorities of Parties or the appropriate authorities of other countries concerning the export to the Union of a chemical the manufacture, use, handling, consumption, transport or sale of which is subject to prohibition or severe restriction under that Party s or other country s legislation shall be made available by means of the Database within 15 days of the Agency s receipt of such notifi cation. The Agency shall, on behalf of the Commission, acknowledge receipt of the first export notification received for each chemical from each Party or other country. The designated national authority of the Member State receiving that import shall receive a copy of any notification received by the Agency, within 10 days of its receipt, together with all available information. Other Member States shall be entitled to receive copies on request. 2.
