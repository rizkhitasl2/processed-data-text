COMMISSION DECISION EU 2018 1927 of 5 December 2018 laying down internal rules concerning the processing of personal data by the European Commission in the field of competition in relation to the provision of information to data subjects and the restriction of certain rights THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 249 1 thereof, Whereas 1 The Commission conducts administrative investigations for the purpose of enforcing the competition rules in accordance with the Treaty and secondary legislation as well as international agreements adopted for that purpose. 1 To that end, it exercises powers of investigation and enforcement including related operational activities in the fields of antitrust, merger control and State aid control conferred on the Commission by the relevant Union acts. 2 Commission investigations and enforcement activities in the field of competition target undertakings or Member States which are subject to the competition rules of the Treaty, and not natural persons as such. Nevertheless, during competition investigations, personal data within the meaning of Article 3 1 of Regulation EU 2018 1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council 2 are inevitably processed within the meaning of Article 3 3 of Regulation EU 2018 1725. The Commission needs to process such personal data in order to fulfil the tasks assigned to it as the public authority enforcing Union competition rules. Investigation in the field of antitrust, merger control and State aid control, and enforcement of competition rules constitute monitoring, inspection or regulatory functions connected to the exercise of official authority in the cases referred to in Article 25 1 c and g of Regulation EU 2018 1725. Those activities serve the promotion and protection of a competitive internal market, thereby safeguarding an important economic and financial interest of the Union and of the Member States. 3 For the purpose of its investigation and enforcement activities in the fields of antitrust, merger control and State aid control, the Commission processes personal data acquired or received from legal persons, natural persons, Member States and other entities such as National Competition Authorities, regulatory bodies and other public bodies and authorities , competition authorities of third countries and international bodies and organ isations. During competition investigations and enforcement activities, whether acting on its own initiative or on the basis of received input, the Commission may also process personal data acquired or received from publicly available sources for example, in the context of market monitoring or screening activities , from anonymous sources for example, whistle blowers informants or identified sources for example, complainants that require protection of their identity. 4 The Commission may, in turn, transmit personal data to legal or natural persons for example, in the context of the access to file procedure , to National Competition Authorities and other authorities and bodies in the context of bilateral or multilateral cooperation with Member States or third country authorities and organisations, as necessary and appropriate to exercise its powers, to safeguard the rights of defence of parties subject to Commission proceedings and to ensure the efficient and effective application of Union competition rules. 5 Personal data processing activities, within the meaning of Article 3 3 of Regulation EU 2018 1725, carried out in the course of investigation and enforcement activities in the field of competition, may take place even before the Commission formally initiates proceedings, continue throughout the handling of the investigation and may continue even after the formal closure of the investigation for example, for the purposes of market or compliance monitoring or screening activities, assessing the need for initiating new investigative activities, legal proceedings, etc. . 10.12.2018 L 313 39 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 See in particular for antitrust Council Regulation EC No 1 2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty OJ L 1, 4.1.2003, p. 1 , for merger control Council Regulation EC No 139 2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings the EC Merger Regulation OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 and for State aid Council Regulation EU 2015 1589 of 13 July 2015 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union OJ L 248, 24.9.2015, p. 9 . 2 Regulation EU 2018 1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation EC No 45 2001 and Decision No 1247 2002 EC OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39 . Processing within the meaning of Article 3 3 of Regulation EU 2018 1725 also includes a situation where the Commission receives personal data voluntarily submitted to it.   6 The personal data processed by the Commission are, for example, identification data, contact data, professional data and data related to or brought in connection with the subject matter of the investigation or procedure. The personal data are stored in a secured electronic environment to prevent unlawful access or transfer of data to persons who do not have a need to know. The personal data are retained in the services of the Commission in charge of the investigation for the time necessary for the investigation, for assessing the need to initiate new investigative activities, during the administrative procedure, and throughout any subsequent judicial review proceedings, and the administrative retention period that follows the definitive closure of the file. At the end of the retention period, the case related information including personal data is transferred to the historical archives of the Commission 1 . 7 While carrying out its tasks, the Commission is bound to respect the rights of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data recognised by Article 8 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and by Article 16 1 of the Treaty. At the same time, the Commission is responsible for enforcing competition rules, which requires the Commission to conduct investigations in a timely manner, while respecting rules of confidentiality and professional secrecy 2 as well as the rights of defence of parties subject to its investi gations, 3 and the rights of individuals that require protection of their identity. 8 In certain circumstances, it is necessary to reconcile the rights of data subjects pursuant to Regulation EU 2018 1725 with the needs of investigations and enforcement activities, as well as with full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms of other data subjects. To that effect, Article 25 of Regulation EU 2018 1725 provides the Commission with the possibility to restrict the application of Articles 14 to 22 and 35, as well as Article 4 thereof, insofar as its provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in Articles 14 to 22 of that Regulation. 9 These internal rules should cover all processing operations carried out by the Commission in the performance of its powers of investigation, whether acting on its own initiative or on the basis of received input, and enforcement and related operational activities in the fields of antitrust, merger control and State aid control whenever the exercise of data subjects rights may jeopardise the conduct of investigations or enforcement activities. These rules should apply to processing operations carried out prior to the formal initiation of proceedings, during the handling of investigations as well as after the formal closure of investigations, including processing in the context of bilateral or multilateral cooperation with National Competition Authorities, Member States or third country authorities and organisations. 10 In order to comply with Articles 14, 15 and 16 of Regulation EU 2018 1725, the Commission should inform all individuals of its activities involving processing of their personal data and of their rights in a transparent and coherent manner in the form of the data protection notices published on the Commission s website. 11 Without prejudice to Articles 14 5 and 16 5 of Regulation EU 2018 1725, the Commission is also able on the basis of Article 25 of that Regulation to restrict the provision of information to data subjects and the application of other rights of data subjects in order to protect its own competition investigations and enforcement of competition rules, investigations and proceedings of competition authorities of the Member States, the investi gation tools and methods, as well as the rights of other persons related to its investigations. 12 In addition, in order to maintain effective cooperation it may be necessary for the Commission to restrict the application of data subjects rights in order to protect processing operations of other Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies or of Member States authorities. To that effect, the Commission should consult those services, institutions, bodies, offices, agencies, and authorities on the relevant grounds for imposing restrictions and the necessity and proportionality of the restrictions. 10.12.2018 L 313 40 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 Retention of files in the Commission is regulated by the Common retention list, a regulatory document the last version is SEC 2012 713 in the form of a retention schedule that establishes the retention periods for the different types of Commission files. 2 See, in particular, Article 339 of the Treaty, as well as Article 28 of Regulation EC No 1 2003 Article 15 4 of Commission Regulation EC No 773 2004 of 7 April 2004 relating to the conduct of proceedings by the Commission pursuant to Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty OJ L 123, 27.4.2004, p. 18 Article 17 of Regulation EC No 139 2004 and Article 18 of Commission Regulation EC No 802 2004 of 21 April 2004 implementing Council Regulation EC No 139 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings OJ L 133, 30.4.2004, p. 1 Articles 30 and 31 of Regulation EU 2015 1589 required declarations on confidential information in State aid notification forms as annexes to Regulation EC No 794 2004 in its amended form. 3 Implementation of the rights of data subjects under the Regulation EU 2018 1725 and compliance with the obligations of data controllers under that Regulation does not affect the Commission s handling of the rights of defence of parties subject to the competition proceedings. The integrity and authenticity of evidence on file collected in the course of competition investigations can therefore not be compromised by modifying documents received or collected in conformity with the applicable procedural rules in the competition field.   13 The Commission may also have to restrict the provision of information to data subjects and the application of other rights of data subjects in relation to personal data received from third countries or international organ isations, in order to cooperate with those countries or organisation and thus safeguard an important objective of general public interest of the Union. However, in some circumstances the interest or fundamental rights of the data subject may override the interest of international cooperation. 14 The Commission has therefore identified the grounds listed in Article 25 1 c , g and h of Regulation EU 2018 1725 as grounds for restrictions under Article 25 of the Regulation that may be necessary to apply to data processing operations carried out in the framework of the Commission s investigative and enforcement activities in the area of competition, encompassing antitrust, merger control and State aid control. 15 The Commission should handle all restrictions in a transparent manner and register each application of restrictions in the corresponding record system. 16 Pursuant to Article 25 8 of Regulation EU 2018 1725, controllers may defer or refrain from providing information on the reasons for the application of a restriction to the data subject if providing that information would in any way compromise the purpose of the restriction. This is, in particular, the case of restrictions to the rights provided for in Articles 16 and 35 of Regulation EU 2018 1725. In order to ensure that the data subject s rights under Articles 16 and 35 of Regulation EU 2018 1725 are restricted only as long as the reasons for the restriction last, the Commission should review its position regularly and at the closure of the relevant investigation. 17 Where a restriction of other rights of data subjects is applied, the controller should assess on a case by case basis whether the communication of the restriction would compromise its purpose. The controller is the service in charge of the competition policy within the Commission. 18 The Data Protection Officer of the Commission should carry out an independent review of the application of restrictions, with a view to ensuring compliance with this Decision. 19 This Decision is adopted for the purposes of Article 25 of Regulation EU 2018 1725 and should enter into force at the same time as that Regulation in order to ensure legal certainty. 20 The European Data Protection Supervisor has been consulted.
