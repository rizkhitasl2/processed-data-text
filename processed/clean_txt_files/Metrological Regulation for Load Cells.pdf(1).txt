The two main categories of OIML publications are International Recommendations OIML R , which are model regulations that establish the metrological charac teristics required of certain measuring instruments and which specify methods and equipment for checking their conformity the OIML Member States shall implement these Recommendations to the greatest possible extent International Documents OIML D , which are inform ative in nature and intended to improve the work of the metrological services. OIML Draft Recommendations and Documents are devel oped by technical committees or subcommittees which are formed by the Member States. Certain international and regional institutions also participate on a consultation basis. Cooperative agreements are established between OIML and certain institutions, such as ISO and IEC, with the objective of avoiding contradictory requirements consequently, manu facturers and users of measuring instruments, test labor atories, etc. may apply simultaneously OIML publications and those of other institutions. International Recommendations and International Docu ments are published in French F and English E and are subject to periodic revision. This publication reference OIML R 60, edition 2000 was developed by the Technical Committee TC 9 Instruments for measuring mass and density. It was approved for final publication by the International Committee of Legal Metrology in 1999 and will be submitted to the International Conference of Legal Metrology in 2000 for formal sanction. It supersedes the previous edition dated 1991 including Annex A, published in 1993 .

It is intended to provide authorities with uniform means for determining the metrological characteristics of load cells used in measuring instruments that are subjected to metrological controls. 1.2 This Recommendation utilizes the principle that several load cell errors shall be considered together when applying load cell performance characteristics to the permitted error envelope. Thus, it is not considered appropriate to specify individual errors for given char acteristics non linearity, hysteresis, etc. , but rather to consider the total error envelope allowed for a load cell as the limiting factor. The use of an error envelope allows the balancing of the individual contributions to the total error of measurement while still achieving the intended final result. Note The error envelope may be defined as the curves that provide the boundary of the maximum per missible errors see Table 5 as a function of the applied load mass over the measuring range. The combined errors determined may be posi tive or negative and include the effects of non linearity, hysteresis and temperature. 1.3 Instruments which are associated with load cells and which give an indication of mass, are the subjects of separate Recommendations. 2 Terminology Terms and definitions The terms most frequently used in the load cell field and their definitions are given below see 2.6 for an illustration of certain definitions . The terminology used in this Recommendation conforms to the International Vocabulary of Basic and General Terms in Metrology, second edition 1993 and the Vocabulary of Legal Met rology 1978 edition .

Adapted from VIM 5.7 Figure 1 Illustration of certain definitions  OIML R 60 2000 E 9 2.6 Illustration of certain definitions The terms that appear above the central horizontal line in Figure 1 below are parameters that are fixed by the design of the load cell. The terms that appear below that line are parameters that are variable, dependent on the conditions of use or in the test of a load cell in particular, those load cells used in weighing instru ments . 3 Units of measurement The units of measurement of mass are the gram g , kilogram kg or tonne t . 4 Metrological requirements 4.1 Principle of load cell classification The classification of load cells into specific accuracy classes is provided to facilitate their application to various mass measuring systems. In the application of this Recommendation, it should be recognized that the effective performance of a particular load cell may be improved by compensation within the measuring sys tem with which it is applied. Therefore, it is not the intent of this Recommendation to require that a load cell be of the same accuracy class as the measuring system in which it may be used. Nor does it require that a measuring instrument, giving indications of mass, use a load cell which has been separately approved.

Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, 1993 6 Requirements for load cells equipped with electronics 6.1 General requirements In addition to the other requirements of this Recom mendation, a load cell equipped with electronics shall comply with the following requirements. The mpe shall be determined using an apportionment factor, pLC, equal to 1.0 pLC 1.0 substituted for the apportion ment factor, pLC, that is declared by the manufacturer and applied to the other requirements. If a load cell is configured with substantially all the electronic functions of an electronic weighing instru ment then it may be required to undergo additional evaluation against other requirements contained in the OIML Recommendation for the weighing instrument. Such evaluation is outside the scope of this Recom mendation.  OIML R 60 2000 E 15 6.1.1 Faults A load cell equipped with electronics shall be designed and manufactured such that when it is exposed to elec trical disturbances either a significant faults do not occur or b significant faults are detected and acted upon. Messages of significant faults should not be confused with other messages presented. Note A fault equal to or smaller than the load cell veri fication interval, v, is allowed irrespective of the value of the error in output. 6.1.2 Durability The load cell shall be suitably durable so that the re quirements of this Recommendation may be met in accordance with the intended use of the load cell. 6.1.3 Compliance with requirements A load cell equipped with electronics is presumed to comply with the requirements in 6.1.1 and 6.1.2, if it passes the examinations specified in 6.3 and 6.4. 6.1.4 Application of the requirements in 6.1.1 The requirements in 6.1.1 may be applied separately to each individual cause or significant fault. The choice of whether 6.1.1 a or 6.1.1 b is applied is left to the manufacturer. 6.2 Acting upon significant faults When a significant fault has been detected, either the load cell shall be made inoperative automatically or a fault detection output shall be issued automatically. This fault detection output shall continue until the user acts on the fault or the fault disappears. 6.3 Functional requirements 6.3.1 Special procedure for load cell with indicator When a load cell equipped with electronics includes an indicator, a special procedure shall be performed upon application of power. This procedure shall show all relevant signs of the indicator in their active and non active states sufficiently long to be checked by the user. 6.3.2 Warm up time During the design warm up time of a load cell equipped with electronics there shall be no transmission of meas urement results. 6.3.3 Mains power supply AC A load cell equipped with electronics that operates from a mains power supply shall be designed to comply with the metrological requirements if the mains power supply varies a in voltage from 15 to 10 of the supply voltage specified by the manufacturer and b in frequency from 2 to 2 of the frequency specified by the manufacturer, if AC is used. 6.3.4 Battery power supply DC A load cell equipped with electronics that operates from a battery power supply shall either continue to function correctly or not provide a measurement result whenever the voltage is below the value specified by the manufacturer. 6.3.5 Disturbances When a load cell equipped with electronics is subjected to the disturbances specified in 6.4.1, the difference between the load cell output due to a disturbance and the load cell output without disturbance load cell intrinsic error shall not exceed the load cell verifica tion interval, v, or the load cell shall detect and react to a significant fault. 6.3.6 Span stability requirements not applicable to class A load cells A load cell equipped with electronics shall be subjected to the span stability test specified in 6.4.1 and A.4.7.8. The variation in load cell span shall not exceed half the load cell verification interval 0.5 v or half the absolute value of the mpe 0.5 mpe , whichever is the greater, for the test load applied. The aim of this test is not to measure the influence on the metrological perform ances of mounting or dismounting the load cell on or from the force generating system, so the installation of the load cell in the force generating system shall be carried out with particular care. 6.4 Additional tests 6.4.1 Performance and stability tests A load cell equipped with electronics shall pass the performance and stability tests according to A.4.7 for the tests given in Table 7.  OIML R 60 2000 E 16 Generally, the tests are carried out on fully operational equipment in its normal state or in a status as similar as possible thereto. If the load cell is equipped with an interface that permits it to be coupled to external equipment, all functions that are performed or initi ated via an interface shall operate correctly. 7 Metrological controls 7.1 Liability to legal metrological controls 7.1.1 Imposition of controls This Recommendation prescribes performance require ments for load cells used in the measurement of mass. National legislation may impose metrological controls that verify compliance with this Recommendation. Such controls, when imposed, may include pattern evalua tion. 7.2 Test requirements Test procedures for the pattern evaluation of load cells are provided in Annex A and the Test Report Format is provided in Annexes C and D. Initial and subsequent verification of load cells independent of the measuring system in which they are used is normally considered inappropriate if the complete system performance is verified by other means. 7.3 Selection of load cells within a family Where a family composed of one or more groups of load cells of various capacities and characteristics is presented for pattern evaluation, the following provi sions shall apply. 7.3.1 Number of load cells to be tested The selection of load cells to be tested shall be such that the number of load cells to be tested is minimized see practical example in Annex B . 7.3.2 Load cells of the same capacity belonging to different groups Where load cells of the same capacity belong to differ ent groups, approval of the load cell with the best metrological characteristics implies approval of the load cells with the lesser characteristics. Therefore, when a choice exists, the load cells with the best metro logical characteristics shall be selected for test. 7.3.3 Load cells with a capacity in between the capacities tested Load cells with a capacity in between the capacities tested, as well as those above the largest capacity tested, but not over 5 times above the largest capacity tested, are deemed to be approved. 7.3.4 Smallest capacity load cell from the group For any family, the smallest capacity load cell from the group with the best characteristics shall be selected for testing. For any group, the smallest capacity load cell in the group shall always be selected for test unless that capacity falls within the range of allowed capacities of selected load cells having better metrological charac teristics according to the requirements of 7.3.2 and 7.3.3. 7.3.5 Ratio of largest capacity to the nearest smaller capacity When the ratio of the largest capacity load cell in each group to the nearest smaller capacity having been Table 7 Performance and stability tests for a load cell equipped with electronics Test Annex A pLC Characteristic test procedure under test Warm up time A.4.7.2 1.0 Influence factor Power voltage variations A.4.7.3 1.0 Influence factor Short time power reductions A.4.7.4 1.0 Disturbance Bursts electrical fast transients A.4.7.5 1.0 Disturbance Electrostatic discharge A.4.7.6 1.0 Disturbance Electromagnetic susceptibility A.4.7.7 1.0 Disturbance Span stability A.4.7.8 1.0 Influence factor  OIML R 60 2000 E 17 selected for test is greater than 5, then another load cell shall be selected. The selected load cell shall have a capacity between 5 and 10 times that of the nearest smaller capacity load cell which has been selected. When no capacity meets this criterion, the selected load cell shall be that having the smallest capacity exceeding 10 times that of the nearest smaller capacity load cell which has been selected. 7.3.6 Humidity test If more than one load cell of a family has been submit ted for testing, only one cell shall be tested for humidity when applicable, and only one cell shall be subjected to the additional tests for load cells equipped with elec tronics when applicable, that being the load cell with the most severe characteristics for example, the greatest value of nmax or the lowest value of vmin .  OIML R 60 2000 E 18 A.1 Scope This Annex provides test procedures for pattern evalu ation testing of load cells used in the measurement of mass. A.1.1 Wherever possible test procedures have been established to apply as broadly as possible to all load cells within the scope of OIML R 60. A.1.2 The procedures apply to the testing of load cells only. No attempt has been made to cover testing of complete systems that include load cells. A.2 Purpose The following test procedures for quantitative deter mination of load cell performance characteristics are established to ensure uniform pattern evaluation. A.3 Test conditions A.3.1 Test equipment The basic equipment for pattern evaluation tests con sists of a force generating system and a suitable linear instrument, which measures the output of the load cell see 5.6 . A.3.2 General considerations for environmental and test conditions Before adequate testing and evaluation of a load cell can be performed, careful attention shall be paid to the environmental and test conditions under which such evaluations are to be made. Significant discrepancies are frequently a result of insufficient recognition of such details. The following shall be thoroughly con sidered prior to any pattern evaluation testing pro gram. Annex A Mandatory Test procedures for pattern evaluation A.3.2.1 Acceleration of gravity The mass standards used in testing shall be corrected, if necessary, for the site of testing and the value of the gravity constant, g, at the test site shall be recorded with the test results. The value of the mass standards used to generate the force shall be traceable to the national standard of mass. A.3.2.2 Environmental conditions Tests shall be performed under stable environmental conditions. The ambient temperature is deemed to be stable when the difference between extreme temper atures noted during the test does not exceed one fifth of the temperature range of the load cell under test, with out being greater than 2 C. A.3.2.3 Loading conditions Particular attention shall be paid to loading conditions to prevent the introduction of errors not inherent to the load cell. Factors such as surface roughness, flatness, corrosion, scratches, eccentricity, etc., should be taken into consideration. Loading conditions shall be in accordance with the requirements of the load cell manufacturer. The loads shall be applied and removed along the sensitive axis of the load cell without intro ducing shock to the load cell. A.3.2.4 Measuring range limits The minimum load, Dmin, hereafter referred to as minimum test load shall be as near as possible to but not less than the minimum dead load, Emin, as permitted by the force generating system. The max imum load, Dmax, hereafter referred to as maximum test load shall be not less than 90 of Emax, nor shall it be greater than Emax refer to Fig. 1 . A.3.2.5 Reference standards Periodic depending on use verification of standards shall be made.  OIML R 60 2000 E 19 A.3.2.6 Stabilization period A stabilization period for the load cell under test and the indicating instrument shall be provided, as recom mended by the manufacturers of the equipment used. A.3.2.7 Temperature conditions It is important to allow sufficient time for temperature stabilization of the load cell to be achieved. Particular attention shall be devoted to this requirement for large load cells. The loading system shall be of a design which will not introduce significant thermal gradients within the load cell. The load cell and its connecting means cables, tubes, etc. which are integral or conti guous shall be at the same test temperature. The indi cating instrument shall be maintained at room temper ature. The temperature effect on auxiliary connecting means shall be considered in determining results. A.3.2.8 Barometric pressure effects Where changes in barometric pressure may signifi cantly affect the load cell output, such changes shall be considered. A.3.2.9 Stability of loading means An indicating instrument and a loading means shall be used which will provide sufficient stability to permit readings within the limits specified in 5.6. A.3.2.10 Indicating instrument checking Some indicating instruments are provided with a con venient means for checking the indicating instrument itself. When such features are provided, they shall be utilized frequently to ensure that the indicating instru ment is within the accuracy required by the test being performed. Periodic verification of the indicating in strument calibration shall also be performed. A.3.2.11 Other conditions Other conditions specified by the manufacturer such as input output voltage, electrical sensitivity, etc. shall be taken into consideration during the test. A.3.2.12 Time and date data All time and date points shall be recorded such that the data can later be presented in test reports in absolute, not relative, units of local time and date. The date shall be recorded in the ISO 8601 format of ccyy mm dd. Note cc may be omitted in cases where there is no possible confusion as to the century. A.3.2.13 Span stability The installation of the load cell in the force generating system shall be done with particular care, since the aim of this test is not to measure the influence on the met rological performances of mounting dismounting the load cell on from the force generating system. A.4 Test procedures Each of the tests below is presented as a stand alone individual test. However, for the efficient conduct of the load cell tests, it is acceptable that the increasing and decreasing load, creep, and minimum dead load output return tests be conducted at the given test temp erature before changing to the next test temperature see A.5, Figures A.1 and A.2 .

At a certain load, L, the digital output value, I, is noted. Additional loads, for example 0.1 v, are successively added until the output of the load cell is increased unambiguously by one digital output increment I v . The additional amount of load, L, added to the load cell gives the digital output value prior to rounding, P, by using the following formula  OIML R 60 2000 E 25 P I 1 2 v L where I the indication or digital output value v the load cell verification interval and L additional load added to the load cell.

B.2 Assume a family consisting of three groups of load cells, differing in class, maximum number of load cell verification intervals, nmax, and maximum capacities, Emax. The capacities, Emax, overlap between the groups according to the following example Class Y lowest Emax, kg highest nmax Group Z vmin, kg C3 12 000 100 300 500 5 000 10 000 30 000 50 000 3 000 2 4 000 0.0083 0.025 0.042 0.42 0.83 2.5 4.17 C6 18 000 50 100 300 500 6 000 1 6 000 0.0028 0.0055 0.0167 0.028 B10 25 000 500 1 000 4 000 10 000 3 10 000 0.020 0.040 0.16 Group 1 Class C, nmax 6 000, Y 18 000, Z 6 000 Emax 50 kg, 100 kg, 300 kg and 500 kg Group 2 Class C, nmax 3 000, Y 12 000, Z 4 000 Emax 100 kg, 300 kg, 500 kg, 5 000 kg, 10 t, 30 t and 50 t Group 3 Class B, nmax 10 000,Y 25 000, Z 10 000 Emax 500 kg, 1 000 kg and 4 000 kg B.2.1 Summarize and sort the load cells with respect to Emax and accuracy as follows  OIML R 60 2000 E 32 B.2.2 Identify the smallest capacity load cells in each group to be tested, according to 7.3.4 Class Y lowest Emax, kg highest nmax Group Z vmin, kg C3 12 000 100 300 500 5 000 10 000 30 000 50 000 3 000 2 4 000 0.0083 0.025 0.042 0.42 0.83 2.5 4.17 C6 18 000 50 100 300 500 6 000 1 6 000 0.0028 0.0055 0.0167 0.028 B10 25 000 500 1 000 4 000 10 000 3 10 000 0.020 0.040 0.16 In this example, select and identify C6 50 kg full evaluation test required B10 500 kg full evaluation test required Although load cell C3 100 kg is the smallest capacity in its group, its capacity falls within the range of other selected load cells having better metrological characteristics. Therefore, it is not selected.  OIML R 60 2000 E 33 In this example, select and identify B10 4 000 kg full evaluation test required Class Y lowest Emax, kg highest nmax Group Z vmin, kg C3 12 000 100 300 500 5 000 10 000 30 000 50 000 3 000 2 4 000 0.0083 0.025 0.042 0.42 0.83 2.5 4.17 C6 18 000 50 100 300 500 6 000 1 6 000 0.0028 0.0055 0.0167 0.028 B10 25 000 500 1 000 4 000 10 000 3 10 000 0.020 0.040 0.16 B.2.3 Begin with the group with the best metrological characteristics in this example, B10 and in accordance with 7.3.5, select the next largest capacity between 5 and 10 times that of the nearest smaller capacity load cell which has been selected. When no capacity meets this criterion, the selected load cell shall be that having the smallest capacity exceeding 10 times that of the nearest smaller capacity load cell which has been selected. Continue this process until all load cell capacities in the group have been considered.  In this example, there is no change to the load cells selected. The capacities of the load cells C6 300 kg and C6 500 kg exceed the capacity of the load cell C6 50 kg by greater than 5 times but not greater than 10 times. However, a 500 kg load cell of better metrological characteristics from group B10 has already been selected. Therefore, in order to minimize the number of load cells to be tested according to 7.3.1, neither cell is selected. OIML R 60 2000 E 34 B.2.4 Move to the group with the next best characteristics in this example, C6 and, in accordance with 7.3.5, select the next largest capacity between 5 and 10 times that of the nearest smaller capacity load cell which has been selected. When no capacity meets this criterion, the selected load cell shall be that having the smallest capacity exceeding 10 times that of the nearest smaller capacity load cell which has been selected. Continue this process until all load cell capacities in the group have been considered. Class Y lowest Emax, kg highest nmax Group Z vmin, kg C3 12 000 100 300 500 5 000 10 000 30 000 50 000 3 000 2 4 000 0.0083 0.025 0.042 0.42 0.83 2.5 4.17 C6 18 000 50 100 300 500 6 000 1 6 000 0.0028 0.0055 0.0167 0.028 B10 25 000 500 1 000 4 000 10 000 3 10 000 0.020 0.040 0.16  OIML R 60 2000 E 35 Class Y lowest Emax, kg highest nmax Group Z vmin, kg C3 12 000 100 300 500 5 000 10 000 30 000 50 000 3 000 2 4 000 0.0083 0.025 0.042 0.42 0.83 2.5 4.17 C6 18 000 50 100 300 500 6 000 1 6 000 0.0028 0.0055 0.0167 0.028 B10 25 000 500 1 000 4 000 10 000 3 10 000 0.020 0.040 0.16 B.2.5 Again, and repeating this process until all groups have been considered, move to the group with the next best characteristics in this example, C3 and in accordance with 7.3.5, select the next largest capacity between 5 and 10 times that of the nearest smaller capacity load cell which has been selected. When no capacity meets this criterion, the selected load cell shall be that having the smallest capacity exceeding 10 times that of the nearest smaller capacity load cell which has been selected. Continue this process until all load cell capacities in the group and all groups have been considered. In this example, select and identify C3 30 000 kg full evaluation test required Proceeding from smallest to largest capacity, the only capacity of load cell which is greater than 5 times the capacity of an already selected load cell but less than 10 times that capacity is the C3 30 000 kg load cell. Since the capacity of the C3 50 000 kg load cell does not exceed 5 times the capacity of the next smaller selected load cell, which is C3 30 000 kg, according to 7.3.3 it is deemed to be approved.  OIML R 60 2000 E 36 Inspect the values of vmin, Y, and Z for all cells of the same capacity. If any load cell of the same capacity has a lower vmin or higher Y than the identified load cell, that load cell or load cells is also liable for partial evaluation testing, specifically the conduct of additional temperature effect on minimum dead load, Emin and barometric pressure effect tests. If any load cell of the same capacity has a higher Y than the selected load cell, that load cell or load cells is also liable for partial evaluation testing, specifically the conduct of additional creep and DR tests. In this example, the load cells identified above also have the best characteristics of lowest vmin, highest Y and highest Z. This is normally the case, but not always. Class Y lowest Emax, kg highest nmax Group Z vmin, kg C3 12 000 100 300 500 5 000 10 000 30 000 50 000 3 000 2 4 000 0.0083 0.025 0.042 0.42 0.83 2.5 4.17 C6 18 000 50 100 300 500 6 000 1 6 000 0.0028 0.0055 0.0167 0.028 B10 25 000 500 1 000 4 000 10 000 3 10 000 0.020 0.040 0.16 B.2.6 After completing steps B.2.2 to B.2.5 and identifying the load cells, compare load cells of the same capacity from different groups. Identify the load cells with the highest accuracy class and highest nmax in each group see shaded portion of table below . For those load cells of the same capacity but from different groups, identify only the one with the highest accuracy class and nmax and lowest vmin.  OIML R 60 2000 E 37 C6 50 kg B10 500 kg B10 4 000 kg C3 30 000 kg None B10 500 kg None Load cells requiring full evaluation test Load cells requiring partial evaluation test Load cell to be tested for humidity Load cells equipped with electronics for additional tests Summary Selected cells B.2.7 If applicable, select the load cell for humidity testing in accordance with 7.3.6, that being the load cell with the most severe characteristics, for example the greatest value of nmax or the lowest value of vmin. In this example, the load cell with the greatest value of nmax or the lowest value of vmin is the same load cell, therefore select B10 500 kg humidity test required Note The other B10 load cells also possess the same qualifications and are possible choices. The 500 kg load cell was chosen because it is the smallest of the applicable B10 capacities. Although the C6 50 kg load cell has the lowest vmin of 0.0028, the B10 load cells have the highest nmax, highest accuracy class, and the highest Y and Z. B.2.8 If applicable, select the load cell for the additional tests to be performed on load cells equipped with electronics in accordance with 7.3.6, that being the load cell with the most severe characteristics, for example the greatest value of nmax or the lowest value of vmin. In this example, no load cell in the family is equipped with electronics. B.2.9 Summarizing, the load cells selected for test are  OIML R 60 2000 E 38 Annex C Mandatory Test report format General C.1 Introduction C.1.1 The objective of the Test Report Format is to provide a standard format for the presentation of test results obtained when evaluating a load cell for conformity with the test procedures described in OIML R 60. C.1.2 In the framework of the OIML Certificate System for Measuring Instruments, applicable to load cells in conformity with R 60 2000 edition , use of this test report format is mandatory, in French and or in English, with translation into the national languages of the countries issuing such certificates, if appropriate. C.1.3 Some of the tests may have to be repeated several times and reported using several identical sheets therefore, report pages must be numbered in the space provided at the top of each page, completed by the indication of the total number of pages. C.2 Calculation procedures C.2.1 In order to facilitate a comparison of the reports established in English and in French, the same abbreviations those of the English language are used in both versions the meanings of these abbreviations is given whenever appropriate. In testing and evaluating load cells for pattern evaluation, it is recognized that the test apparatus and practices used by the various laboratories will be different. OIML R 60 allows for these variations and still provides a method for testing, recording and calculating results that are readily understandable by other knowledgeable parties reviewing the data. In order to achieve this ease of comparability it is necessary that those persons conducting the tests use a common system for recording data and calculating results. Thus, it is essential that the calculation procedures below be reviewed and followed closely in the completion of this test report. C.2.2 Load cell errors EL Error Load test C.2.2.1 Complete a Table D.1 3 runs for each test temperature, calculate the averages and record in the right hand column. When five runs are necessary, use Table D.1 5 runs . C.2.2.2 Determine the conversion factor, f, which is the number of indicated units per load cell verification interval, v, and is used to convert all indicated units to v . It is determined from the test data averages of the increasing load tests at the initial 20 C nominal test temperature.  OIML R 60 2000 E 39 C.2.2.3 If a test load corresponding to 75 of the measuring range for the load cell under test i.e., 2 250 divisions for a 3 000 division cell, which is Dmin plus 75 of the difference between Dmax and Dmin is not included in the test loads used in Table D.1, interpolate between the adjacent upper and lower values of the averages of all three test runs and record in Table D.2 see 5.2.2 . C.2.2.4 Calculate the difference between the average indication on the increasing load test runs at 75 of the difference between Dmax and Dmin and the indication at Dmin.

In recording this data, indicate a no test load indication as 0 . This may require subtracting the no load indication from the test load indication so that the first entry in the column is 0 . These 0 s have been preprinted on the form to clarify that a dead load condition is recorded as 0 . C.2.2.6 Calculate the reference indication, Ri, by converting the net test load, in mass units, to v units, by multiplying by the conversion factor, f, for each test load and recording in the 2nd column in Table D.2. Ri test load Dmin Dmax Dmin n f where f indicated units v C.2.2.7 In Table D.2 calculate the difference between the average test indication and the reference indication for each test load at each test temperature and divide by f to obtain the error, EL, for each test load in terms of v.

CC 30 20 test indication at 30 minutes test indication at 20 minutes f C.2.5.4 CC 30 20 must not exceed 0.15 times the absolute value of the mpe for the test load. C.2.5.5 Calculate the difference between the test indication at the minimum test load, Dmin, before and after the creep test and divide by f to obtain the minimum dead load output return, CDR, error in terms of v. CDR minimum test load indication2 minimum test load indication1 f C.2.5.6 If the time intervals specified in Table 6 have been met, CDR must not exceed 0.5 v. If the actual time is between 100 and 150 of the specified time, then CDR must not exceed 0.5 1 x 1 in units of v, where x actual time specified time C.2.5.7 OIML R 76 requires calculations involving the minimum dead output return, DR, value to be carried out. Whereas CDR expresses the minimum dead load output return in terms of v, the value of DR is expressed in units of mass g, kg or t .  OIML R 60 2000 E 41 1 This test may not be necessary depending on the design of the load cell. 2 This test is not necessary if the load cell is marked NH or SH. C.2.5.8 Calculate the minimum dead load output return, DR, value as follows DR Emax CDR nmax C.2.5.9 The value of DR must not exceed 0.5 v, expressed in units of mass. C.2.5.10 Regardless of the value declared by the manufacturer for the apportionment factor, pLC, the mpe for creep shall be determined from Table 5 using the apportionment factor, pLC 0.7 see 5.3.1.1 .
