The work of the department supports economic prosperity across the country, including in regional Australia, and will help drive the global transition to a low carbon future. Australia s resources sector and industry will play a vital role in this transition. The resources sector drives economic growth, creates regional jobs, lifts the standard of living for Australians, and fosters innovation and productivity. Traditional commodities, including energy resources, will continue to support Australia s economy and supply global demand while contributing to energy security through the transition to net zero by 2050. A key objective is for Australia to remain a stable and reliable energy supplier to both our domestic industries and regional partners, supplying the energy we all need to realise our emission reduction goals. Gas has an important role in our energy mix, providing firming to the energy grid to complement the increasing contribution of renewables. Gas is critical to the industries that rely on it as a feedstock for manufacturing products, including plastics and fertiliser. The department is implementing reforms to secure our domestic supply, including by reforming the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism ADGSM and monitoring the effectiveness of the new Heads of Agreement signed with East Coast LNG exporters on 29 September 2022. The Government has committed 65.7 million to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the department s oversight of domestic gas supply. Through program delivery and stakeholder engagement the department is supporting the Government s intention for the resources sector to diversify, add value, and seize new opportunities in critical minerals. Critical minerals supply chains are pivotal to reducing global emissions. Demand for critical minerals is set to continue to grow, driven by increased uptake of clean energy technologies, from lithium ion batteries to solar panels, and wind turbines to electric vehicles. The 99.8 million Critical Minerals Development Program will help early and mid stage critical mineral projects overcome technical and market barriers.   Portfolio Budget Statements Page 14 Department of Industry, Science and Resources Six grants have been approved under the program 15.5 million for Alpha HPA Ltd s HPA First Product Expansion Project to add new capabilities to the ultra pure aluminium chemical plant and produce materials for the lithium ion battery and synthetic sapphire markets 15 million to accelerate Cobalt Blue Holdings Definitive Feasibility Study for its projects to produce intermediate and battery ready cobalt products in Australia 6 million for EQ Resources tungsten project for use in metal alloys for defence, transport and other applications 4 million for Global Advanced Metals Pty Ltd s Tantalum and Tin Recovery Plant to increase the volume of tantalum that is produced in Australia. Up to 5.2 million for Lava Blue s project to develop modular re processing technology to recover high purity alumina, magnesium and other critical minerals from vanadium mine waste and 3.9 million for Mineral Commodities Ltd to develop an Australian integrated graphite ore to battery anodes business, producing battery grade graphite. The Government is establishing a 50.5 million Australian Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub, which will bring together globally recognised experts within Geoscience Australia, CSIRO, and ANSTO to prioritise and advance strategically significant projects, work with the research community and industry to build and commercialise Australian IP, and collaborate with Australia s international partners. There is also a 2.0 million commitment to invest in a Resources Centre of Excellence Hub to provide mine workers and the resources community with access to training and emerging technologies to support future employment and growth opportunities. Consistent with the Government s commitment to protecting Australia s unique environment and supporting Australia s sector to be a leader in the transition to net zero, the Government is delivering 10.0 million to fund research, development and demonstration projects for commercial methane abatement in the resources sector. A key focus for the department is establishing the 15 billion National Reconstruction Fund NRF , the first step in the Government s plan to diversify and transform Australia s industry and economy to secure future prosperity. The NRF will provide finance to drive investments that add value and capability in the following seven priority areas Renewables and low emission technologies Medical science Value add in resources  Portfolio Budget Statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Page 15 Transport Value add in agriculture, forestry and fisheries Defence capability Enabling capabilities, such as data science, artificial intelligence AI , robotics, and quantum. The NRF will be governed by an independent board, with investment decisions made by the board based on the Government s priorities. The NRF will be underpinned by co investment plans, which will identify high level investment opportunities and broader potential reforms to support growth and competitiveness in Australian industry. The Government is looking to the future and seizing strategic and critical opportunities to complement the work of the NRF as part the Government s A Future Made in Australia agenda. This includes Implementing a 10 point Buy Australian Plan to improve the way Australian Government contracts work, ensuring more opportunities are available to Australian businesses and their employees. Recent years have demonstrated that government procurement policy is a major economic lever to drive economic recovery from COVID 19. 14.2 million for a National Rail Manufacturing Plan to help stimulate the Australian rail industry to build more trains in Australia and support skilled manufacturing jobs. Implementation of the Plan includes establishing an Office of National Rail Industry Coordination, appointing a Rail Supplier Advocate, and establishing a Rail Industry Innovation Council. Developing Australia s first National Battery Strategy with a shared vision and actions to grow an end to end Australian battery industry. Initiatives under the measure Supporting Australian Industry are a part of the Government s commitment to back local manufacturing and ensure that Australia is a country that can make things again, including by mobilising our science and technology capabilities. Eight grants are being provided to critical and strategic businesses, mostly in regional communities, to boost local jobs, help support businesses to transition to net zero and strengthen vulnerable critical supply chains exposed by the pandemic. These include 50.0 million to upgrade the Nyrstar Hobart zinc smelter in Tasmania to produce low carbon zinc. 17.2 million to establish a pilot Food Manufacturing Innovation Hub on the Central Coast of New South Wales. 12.6 million for Cytiva s Springfield Biopark project in Queensland to build capability for a highly skilled manufacturing workforce.   Portfolio Budget Statements Page 16 Department of Industry, Science and Resources 11.1 million for upgrades to Ingham s Sorell poultry facility in Tasmania to support sustainable manufacturing in Australia s poultry sector. 10.1 million to expand Flinders University s Factory of the Future in South Australia and establish the Manufacturing Growth Accelerator Program. 6.1 million to upgrade the Waverly Wool Mill in Tasmania to transform Australia s oldest textile mill to a state of the art sustainable wool recycling facility. 2.1 million to support a feasibility study to replace the coal fired boiler at the Norske Skog Boyer Mill in Tasmania, to enable Norske Skog to transition to a cleaner production line. 2.1 million to expand the Coast Group berry distribution centre in Tasmania, to allow Tasmania s berry industry to expand regional production of berries. Having a high level of consumer confidence in Australian goods and services is crucial for driving exports, economic growth and business innovation. This occurs through enhancing regulatory settings for businesses and communities to encourage ethical and sustainable market growth while reducing obstacles to collaboration and investment. In this Budget this includes 6.1 million to support Ethical Clothing Australia to expand a national ethical accreditation arrangement for the Australian textile, clothing and footwear TCF industry. This will help local and international consumers choose ethical Australian TCF products. 1.6 million to work with the seafood and hospitality sectors to develop implementation options for mandatory country of origin labelling for seafood in hospitality, to help consumers know if the seafood they order is Australian, while minimising costs and compliance burden on business. Technology plays a critical role in the Australian economy, from assisting businesses to grow, improve productivity and further innovate, to helping keep Australians safe in the event of natural disasters. It is crucial for Australia to become an even more resilient economy by building sovereign capabilities in critical technologies, backing our competitive strengths, and opening opportunities for all Australians. These opportunities in the digital economy will underpin our future success and help build a stronger, fairer and more productive economy. The department is supporting the Government s work to harness Australia s science and technology capabilities and help ensure that Australia realises the opportunities offered by digital transformation, while putting in place the foundations to make the most of new and emerging technologies like AI, robotics, and quantum computing. Together this work will support Australia to achieve the Government s target of 1.2 million tech related jobs by 2030. In this Budget, this includes  Portfolio Budget Statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Page 17 13.5 million for enhancing government s access to expert advice on critical technologies to ensure Australia can capture opportunities and manage the risks associated with critical technologies. This will further enable Australia to maintain cutting edge critical technology development and increase our nation s future prosperity, productivity and economic resilience while balancing our national security risks. Development of a National Quantum Strategy to ensure Australia can capitalise on its existing quantum technology capability and train the next generation of quantum technology specialists. This includes 4.8 million to provide support for quantum researchers to help attract and retain our nation s quantum talent onshore.

The organisation s primary functions are set out in the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987. ANSTO is Australia s national nuclear research and development organisation, and the centre of Australian nuclear expertise. ANSTO operates a large proportion of Australia s landmark research infrastructure, including the OPAL multipurpose reactor, the Australian Synchrotron, the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering ACNS , and the Centre for Accelerator Science CAS . Thousands of researchers from across Australia and around the world partner with ANSTO to tackle complex problems that improve human health, save lives, build Australian industries, and protect the environment. ANSTO is the centre of nuclear medicine production in Australia. On average, ANSTO s radioisotopes enable 10,000 to 12,000 nuclear medicine procedures that benefit Australians each week battling cancer and other diseases. ANSTO s daily operations are critical to the health and wellbeing of the country. In 2022 23, ANSTO will deliver the first stage of a multi phased project for a new world leading nuclear medicine manufacturing facility, as the existing facility is nearing the end of its useful life. The project will create a facility design to provide Australian patients with technetium, lutetium, and iodine based products, and that will have the flexibility to respond to market and technological changes. The modern design will also enable greater process automation than is possible with the existing facility, leading to improvements in efficiency, quality, and, importantly, the highest levels of production and personal safety. In 2022 23, ANSTO will continue to provide expert advice and support to the Nuclear Powered Submarine Taskforce, baselining and augmenting Australia s stewardship capabilities and credentials. ANSTO has established a small, multidisciplinary team of experts to support this work. In addition, ANSTO will continue to prioritise activities and research to support Australia s response to the unprecedented challenges the country is facing including ANSTO scientists and its collaborators utilising our unique infrastructure, such as the Australian Synchrotron to better understand the structure of viruses, including COVID 19 which, in turn, assists in the development of vaccines and treatments.   Portfolio Budget Statements Page 78 Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Understanding climate change including contributions to Australia s critical Antarctic research program and its impact on Australia and its neighbours. Conducting research into Australian bushfires to assist with planning, mitigation, and response to extreme bushfire events. Prioritising water research and partnering with communities to provide a scientific basis for managing and sustaining Australia s precious groundwater resources. ANSTO s Australian Synchrotron continues its partner funded 95 million BR GHT beamline expansion program, with eight new beamlines being constructed. This will nearly double the Synchrotron s capacity and allow for broader engagement with researchers and industry in a range of applications, from high tech manufacturing, including aerospace and transport, to health, including drug development and medical implants. This investment supports the 520 million of operational funding provided by the Australian Government. More information on ANSTO, its strategic objectives, and major activities can be found in ANSTO s corporate plan and website  Portfolio Budget Statements Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Page 79 1.2 Entity resource statement Table 1.1 shows the total funding from all sources available to the entity for its operations and to deliver programs and services on behalf of the Government.

Portfolio Budget Statements Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Page 81 Section 2 Outcomes and planned performance Government outcomes are the intended results, impacts or consequences of actions by the Government on the Australian community. Commonwealth programs are the primary vehicle by which government entities achieve the intended results of their outcome statements. Entities are required to identify the programs which contribute to government outcomes over the Budget and forward years. Each outcome is described below together with its related programs. The following provides detailed information on expenses for each outcome and program, further broken down by funding source.

CSIRO has several subsidiaries, including the Science and Industry Endowment Fund SIEF , the CSIRO Chile Research Fundación Fundación , National ICT Australia NICTA , the Innovation Fund entities and the US Office entities. Budgeted Departmental Income Statement The revenue from Government estimate for 2022 23 is 991.1 million. This is a decrease from the 991.3 million reported in the 2022 23 March Budget. CSIRO is expecting an operating surplus in 2022 23, 2024 25 and 2025 26 predominantly due to revenue funding for the purchase of non financial assets. CSIRO is expecting an operating loss in 2023 24 due to the distribution of funds by the Science and Industry Endowment Fund and unfunded depreciation expenses relating to assets for which capital was previously provided by the Government. Budgeted Departmental Balance Sheet Other investments are estimated to increase in 2022 23 and the forward estimates as a result of the Expand the CSIRO Innovation Fund Main Sequence Ventures measure in the 2022 23 March Budget. Land and buildings are estimated to decrease in 2023 24 and 2025 26 due to planned site divestment in line with the CSIRO 2019 29 Property Strategy and leased assets depreciating at a higher rate as the leases near their close. Property, plant and equipment assets are estimated to increase in 2022 23 from 2021 22 due to an increase in budgeted asset transfers.   Portfolio Budget Statements Page 120 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Departmental Capital Budget Statement The budgeted internally funded capital expenditure relates to construction of new, and refurbishment of existing, buildings and purchase of plant and equipment, including scientific equipment and information technology related assets. The total capital budget estimate for 2022 23 is 279.5 million, an increase from the 180.6 million reported in the 2022 23 March Budget. The movement is mainly due to moving unspent funds into 2022 23 from 2021 22 and an increase in estimated income including external revenue and gains for the purchase of assets.

Its purpose is to be the trusted advisor on Earth sciences to inform government, community and industry decision making. This contributes to a strong economy, resilient society and sustainable environment. During the Budget and forward years, Geoscience Australia will implement and progress Australian Government priorities and key Budget measures. Through the Positioning Australia program, Geoscience Australia is implementing a national system for open, reliable and high accuracy positioning across Australia. A national network of ground stations and a Satellite Based Augmentation System will deliver positioning data accurate to 10 cm across Australia, and 3 to 5 cm in areas of mobile phone coverage. The 4 year 2020 2024 , 124.5 million Exploring for the Future phase two program will continue to deliver high quality data and information that improves the understanding of the nation s resource potential. This is driving the next generation of mineral, energy, and groundwater discoveries in Australia that will underpin Australia s path to net zero, attract investment, generate jobs and secure the resources we need into the future. Over 4 years from 2020 21, Geoscience Australia is delivering the 30.9 million Data Driven Discoveries initiative. Geoscience Australia is collating and applying modern analysis techniques to reprocess old geoscientific information and data, some from as far back as the 1960s, and will be collecting new geoscientific data to deepen our knowledge of a key underexplored area of south west Queensland. The program will help discover potential for hydrogen storage, critical minerals, groundwater, and carbon capture and storage, stimulating new investments in the region. Geoscience Australia has partnered with the Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics to establish the Australian Climate Service. Funding announced in May 2021 of 209.7 million over 4 years to establish the Australian Climate Service is supporting better connection and leveraging of the Government s extensive data, information and capabilities to inform climate and disaster risk management.   Portfolio Budget Statements Page 136 Geoscience Australia In the 2021 22 Budget, the Australian Government committed 40.2 million over 4 years to develop a Digital Atlas of Australia. The Digital Atlas of Australia will be a free, interactive geospatial map that will provide valuable data on Australia s population, economy, employment, infrastructure, health, land and the environment. This will support governments, businesses and the community to make more informed decisions about planning, infrastructure and investment at the local and national level. Geoscience Australia is continuing to support implementation of the Australian Government s Civil Space Strategy by helping ensure the benefits of space data are realised on Earth, including through its work to connect the space and spatial sectors of the economy. The organisation is working with the Australian Space Agency and other partners to support implementation of the Earth Observations from Space Technology Roadmap, a document that provides the Australian space industry with guidance on opportunities for satellite technology development. In 2022, Geoscience Australia is working with the Australian Space Agency to develop an equivalent technology roadmap for Positioning, Navigation and Timing. Through the Digital Earth Australia program, Geoscience Australia will continue to provide free and open satellite data and derived information products to support Australian governments to make better decisions on policy, investment, management and operations, and Australian industry and business to create new capabilities that increase efficiency, productivity and employment opportunities across the Australian economy. As part of the Australian Government s National Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub, funding of 9.4 million has been allocated to Geoscience Australia over 4 years in the 2022 23 October Budget to undertake research that will identify benefits to Australia s critical mineral sector.

This is mainly due to a 71.8 million increase in appropriation revenue from the Australian Government, mainly comprised of Satellite Based Augmentation System net increase of 65.2 million. Exploring for the Future phase two increase of 6.3 million. Strategic Basin Plans increase of 6.0 million. National Space Mission for Earth Observation not for publication. Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub increase of 0.9 million. Savings from External Labour, Advertising, Travel and Legal Expenses decrease of 11.6 million. The budgeted deficit for 2022 23 is 13.9 million. The deficit represents depreciation and amortisation on fixed assets of 10.2 million, which is not funded under the Government s net cash appropriation arrangements, and depreciation and amortisation on right of use assets of 27.4 million, less principal payments on leased assets of 23.7 million. Budgeted Departmental Balance Sheet Geoscience Australia s budgeted total assets of 577.5 million and total liabilities of 442.3 million in 2022 23 represent an increase of 87.2 million and 83.8 million respectively from 2021 22. This reflects an expected increase in appropriations receivable and supplier payables associated with recent measures. Budgeted Capital Budget Statement Planned capital expenditure for Geoscience Australia in 2022 23 is 17.3 million. This comprises capital expenditure funded from equity injections of 9.6 million and the departmental capital budget of 7.7 million.
