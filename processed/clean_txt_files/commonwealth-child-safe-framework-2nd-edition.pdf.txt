In 2013, the Australian Government appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Over the course of its five year inquiry, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse the Royal Commission considered a range of related matters, including what institutions and governments should do to better protect children against child sexual abuse in institutional contexts in the future. In its consideration of this issue, the Royal Commission examined what makes an organisation child safe, and how to embed child safety in an organisation s culture. This includes adequate recruitment and screening practices to assist in the selection of appropriate people to work with children, establishing and implementing child safe policies, and developing complaint handling procedures that are child safe. Many of the Royal Commission s findings are applicable to Commonwealth entities. For example, the Royal Commission s 2015 Working with Children Checks Report recommended that the Commonwealth should identify all staff, including contractors, undertaking child related work and require them to obtain a Working with Children Check. A recommendation of the Final Report of the Royal Commission was that all institutions should act with the best interests of the child as their primary consideration and should implement a number of principles identified by the Royal Commission to achieve this. 1 As part of its response to the Royal Commission, in August 2017 the Australian Government committed to the development and implementation of a new Commonwealth wide framework to protect children and young people who may have contact with Commonwealth entities the Commonwealth Child Safe Framework the Framework .2 The Framework sets minimum standards for Commonwealth entities to create and maintain behaviours and practices that are safe for children. The Framework includes four key requirements and guidance for implementation. Additional support and guidance is available from the National Office for Child Safety within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. You can contact the National Office at commonwealthchildsafe pmc.gov.au. 1 Referred to as the Child Safe Standards in the Final Report of the Royal Commission and now incorporated into the National Principles for Child Safe Organisations. 2 Throughout the Framework, children refers to children and young people.   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 5 1.2 Child safe cultures Child safety is more than a Framework. The Framework provides minimum standards for Commonwealth entities to protect children. However, it is important to understand that child safety goes beyond policies and compliance activities. While compliance with this Framework helps keep entities accountable for their child safe practices, creating a culture that prioritises the safety and wellbeing of children requires genuine commitment at all levels of an organisation. Child safe cultures are a protective factor without a child safe culture, organisations are at a greater risk of child safety incidents occurring and being underreported, as children and adults may not feel confident identifying or raising child safety concerns. Creating policies and procedures to protect children is the first step in the journey to being a child safe organisation. Leaders should demonstrate and champion child safe approaches, all staff must be made aware of the policies and procedures, and abide by them, and child safety incidents must be acknowledged and managed appropriately by staff and the broader organisation. Maintaining a child safe culture requires ongoing effort and continuous improvement. Protecting children is everybody s business. Regardless of the size of an organisation or how often they interact with children, every member of every organisation has a role to play in keeping children safe.   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 6 1.3 Requirements The Framework sets out four core requirements. Together, these comprise the minimum standards required of Commonwealth entities to protect children. Under the Framework, Commonwealth entities are required to Core requirements under the Framework for Commonwealth entities REQUIREMENT 1 Undertake risk assessments annually in relation to activities of the entity, to identify the level of responsibility for, and contact with, children, evaluate risks to child safety, and put in place appropriate strategies to manage identified risks. REQUIREMENT 2 Establish and maintain a system of training and compliance, to make staff aware of, and compliant with, the Framework and relevant legislation, including Working with Children Checks Working with Vulnerable People Checks and mandatory reporting requirements. REQUIREMENT 3 Adopt and implement the National Principles for Child Safe Organisations. REQUIREMENT 4 Publish an annual statement of compliance with the Framework including an overview of the entity s child safety risk assessment conducted under Requirement 1 . To implement the Framework, entities should develop their own internal child safe policies, consistent with the requirements above, and taking into account agency specific risks identified in annual risk assessments. More information on implementation of each of the requirements is set out in Part Two. Additional guidance is also available on the National Office for Child Safety s website. Making child safety materials publically available Requirement 4 of the Framework requires entities to publish an annual statement of compliance with the Framework. In addition to this, entities are encouraged to make other child safety related materials publically available for example, by publishing on their website . Making these documents available helps ensure staff and stakeholders are aware of policies and procedures, and their implementation promotes transparency and accountability and helps to build the trust and confidence of children and adults in the community. It is also consistent with Principles 1 and 10 of the National Principles see 2.3, below . Depending on the entity s operational environment and what materials have been developed, child safety materials may include a departmental child safety framework, other child safety policies and procedures such as a Working with Children Checks Policy , or a child related complaints handling policy. Entities are not expected to publish documents that contain information that is classified or operationally sensitive.   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 7 1.4 Application of the Framework The Framework applies to all non corporate Commonwealth entities. It is recommended for application to other Commonwealth bodies, including corporate Commonwealth entities and Commonwealth companies. Accountable Authorities of Commonwealth entities are responsible for the implementation of the Framework within their entity. Application to Commonwealth funded third parties To increase the reach of the Commonwealth s commitment to child safety, Commonwealth entities should put in place measures to promote the protection of children in services and activities they fund.3 The decision to apply the Framework to funded third parties is at the discretion of the relevant Accountable Authority. It is recommended that, where appropriate, entities impose child safety requirements consistent with the Framework on any individuals or organisations they fund to provide services directly to children, or for activities that involve contact with children that is a usual part of, and more than incidental to, the funded activity. These requirements should be imposed in written form, including, but not limited to, funding through grants and procurements. Templates for child safety clauses that can be included in third party funding agreements are available for grants and procurements from the Department of Finance s Simple and Standard Grant Agreement templates and Procurement Clausebank, respectively. Guidance is also available on the National Office for Child Safety s website. 3 This relates to recommendation 6.13 of the Final Report of the Royal Commission.   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 8 Part Two Guidance for the implementation of the Commonwealth Child Safe Framework 2.1 Requirement 1 Risk assessment and mitigation Commonwealth entities are required to conduct annual risk assessments to evaluate risks to child safety and implement strategies to manage those risks. Risk assessments play an important role in creating a child safe environment where people consider and address risks to children before and as they arise.4 The operating environments of Commonwealth entities are frequently changing. Undertaking risk assessments annually embeds regular review, identification and mitigation of possible child safety concerns.5 As part of the risk assessment entities should consider Types of CONTACT Types of RISK FACTORS Types of MITIGATION FACTORS Types of contact Known and potential contact and interactions should be considered by entities, including Direct physical contact Face to face contact Verbal communications Written communication Electronic and online communication This includes staff providing direct personal care, advisory, education or other support services, or interactions through consultations and interviews. It also includes less direct interactions for example, where staff interact with children who are accompanying their parents to a service, shopfront or conference, or where third parties are funded for activities involving children. 4 Under Requirement 4 of the Framework, the outcome of an entity s child safety risk assessment should be included as part of the required annual statement. 5 Principle 9 of the National Principles states Implementation of the national child safe principles is regularly reviewed and improved.   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 9 Types of risk factors A wide range of risk factors should be considered by entities, including The nature of the entity s work Staff screening processes Staff contact with children and the risk of abuse Systemic risks weaknesses in governance and response management policies and processes e.g. out of date corporate policies and processes Environmental risks including physical, cultural and online environments Third party providers funded to engage with children An Implementation Self assessment Checklist is available to guide Commonwealth entities in implementing the Framework and identifying risks and areas for improvement. Types of mitigation strategies Entities should put in place appropriate strategies to manage any identified child safety risks. Mitigation strategies include, but are not limited to Policies, training and compliance Clear child safe policies and training reflect current best practice and are available and accessible Child safety is embedded in an organisation s online presence, social media and communication policies and in codes of conduct Regular communications are made to staff regarding child safety related issues Complaints policies and procedures are available and accessible for children e.g. through child friendly versions, where possible Children and staff are aware of the rights of children and children are supported to exercise these rights Policies and processes that affect children, including those related to the National Principles for Child Safe Organisations, are regularly reviewed and updated Child safe recruitment and screening practices Behaviour based interview questions are used Working with Children Checks are undertaken Reference checks are undertaken Police checks are undertaken Child safety induction training is provided to relevant staff at their commencement   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 10 Types of mitigation strategies continued Child focused and child safe environments Contact with children occurs in visible work environments such as glass panelled offices and meeting rooms, and open plan offices Products materials developed for children are easily accessible, e.g. child friendly language, stored in open areas Contact with children is culturally appropriate and interpreters who are suitably trained in working with children and or child safe matters are used if needed Children are accompanied by a parent or guardian Staff are supervised, where appropriate, in situations where they have contact with children, including online virtual contact Child safety is considered in the design and delivery of online and virtual spaces that may involve children Child safety training is routinely provided to all relevant staff Complaints handling and reporting6 Child safety training is routinely provided to all relevant staff Complaints escalation and disclosure procedures are documented, easily accessible and, if possible, in child friendly language. These procedures are communicated to staff Complaints and disclosures are responded to according to procedures Trauma informed approaches are used where relevant Staff are aware of and follow appropriate record keeping practices Contracts and grants Accountable Authority Instructions include direction on child safety Inclusion of child safety requirements and, if relevant, key performance indicators in contracts and grants 6 The Complaint Handling Guide Upholding the rights of children and young people provides practical guidance on handling complaints involving children.   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 11 2.2 Requirement 2 Training and compliance Commonwealth entities are required to make staff aware of, and comply with, the Framework and relevant legislation. The availability of information, education and training for staff is important in creating a child focused, transparent and safe organisational culture which protects children and keeps them safe. The level of child safety training and compliance required may vary depending on the level of interaction the entity has with children. Ensuring children s safety is everyone s responsibility. This means not only those who undertake child related work as defined by their relevant state or territory Working with Children or Working with Vulnerable People Check legislation , but also anyone who may have contact with or make decisions that affect children. At a minimum, to ensure staff are aware of and comply with the Framework and relevant legislation, entities should Actions Have clear and well communicated policies that meet the requirements of the Framework and manage any additional child related risks specific to the agency An important component of any policy is reporting and handling of reports of child abuse. It may include what to do if the reporter or victim does not want their details provided to authorities i.e. blind reporting and any mandatory reporting requirements Policies should include provision of a supportive and safe environment for staff who disclose abuse or risk of abuse Policies should be publically available and include child friendly language, where possible Provide training to staff about their obligations under the Framework and any internal child safety policies This could be achieved through face to face or online training, induction processes, or other means appropriate to the nature of the entity and its staff Staff should be aware of their obligations, where relevant, from the commencement of their role. Training should be ongoing Have in place robust staff screening processes to check the suitability of staff working with children7 All staff comply with applicable working with children and or working with vulnerable people legislation All staff comply with applicable mandatory reporting requirements All staff comply with applicable failure to report and failure to protect offences 7 A list of legislation is in Part Three Material to support implementation of the Commonwealth Child Safe Framework.   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 12 Actions continued Have a system to monitor ongoing compliance with training requirements and Working with Children Checks Working with Vulnerable People Checks Establish and maintain a system to manage Working with Children Checks Working with Vulnerable People Checks and keep them current8 Establish and maintain a system to monitor staff training Training Operational requirements vary across the Commonwealth, therefore each entity is responsible for establishing their training regime, the content of the training, and deciding who is required to complete training. In general, entities with higher levels of interaction with children are expected to have more thorough and regular child safety training for relevant staff. These entities may choose to implement a tiered training program depending on a business area s level of interaction with children. Entities with minimal interaction with children may implement more general introductory training, such as online modules, or a general communication plan to inform staff of the Framework, relevant legal obligations, and the application of the Framework to funded third parties. When developing training, entities may consider creating their own training, using existing material available through the National Office for Child Safety s website, which includes advice on training or materials developed by other Commonwealth entities, or procuring third party training services.9 8 This relates to recommendation 3c of the Royal Commission s 2015 Working with Children Checks report. 9 Procurement of a third party provider to deliver child safe training is at the entity s discretion. The National Office for Child Safety does not certify or accredit training providers.   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 13 2.3 Requirement 3 National Principles for Child Safe Organisations Commonwealth entities are required to adopt and implement the National Principles.10 The National Principles are fundamental to an organisation being child safe. They provide a consistent approach to creating and maintaining organisational cultures and practices that foster child safety and wellbeing. The National Principles are flexible in how they can be implemented across different sectors and types of organisations11. Commonwealth entities are required to implement the National Principles to help establish and improve child safe cultures and practices. In line with Principle 9, implementation of the National Principles in an entity should be regularly reviewed. National Principles for Child Safe Organisations 1 Child safety and wellbeing is embedded in organisational leadership, governance and culture 2 Children and young people are informed about their rights, participate in decisions affecting them, and are taken seriously 3 Families and communities are informed and involved in promoting child safety and wellbeing 4 Equity is upheld and diverse needs respected in policy and practice 5 People working with children and young people are suitable and supported to reflect child safety and wellbeing values in practice 6 Processes for complaints and concerns are child focused 7 Staff and volunteers are equipped with the knowledge, skills and awareness to keep children and young people safe through ongoing education and training 8 Physical and online environments promote safety and wellbeing, while minimising the opportunity for children and young people to be harmed 9 Implementation of the national child safe principles is regularly reviewed and improved 10 Policies and procedures document how the organisation is safe for children and young people 10 The National Principles embed the Royal Commission s recommended Child Safe Standards and are the vehicle for giving effect to recommendations relating to the standards. 11 State and territory governments are responsible for implementing the National Principles in their respective jurisdictions. Jurisdictions may have existing mandated approaches to child safety in organisations.   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 14 A range of resources and materials are available to support organisations implement the National Principles. These materials include Online training modules one introductory module and one module on each of the National Principles Introductory Self assessment Tool Example Charter of Commitment to the National Principles Checklist for Online Safety for Organisations Guide for Parents and Carers Example Code of Conduct for Organisations Child Safety and Wellbeing Policy template Complaint Handling Guide Upholding the rights of children and young people. These training and support materials are available through the National Office for Child Safety website.   Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Second Edition 15 2.4 Requirement 4 Annual child safety statement Commonwealth entities are required to publish an annual statement of compliance with the Framework including an overview of the entity s child safety risk assessment conducted under Requirement 1 . A public and transparent commitment to child safety is a key part of keeping organisations accountable for their child safe cultures and practices. The importance of an organisation s public commitment to child safety is highlighted in Principle 1 of the National Principles see 2.3, above . By 31 October each year, Commonwealth entities are required to publish an annual child safety statement which outlines the outcome of the entity s child safety risk assessment and compliance with the Framework over the previous year.12 At a minimum, the statement should include A statement of the entity s commitment to child safety A description of the entity s interaction with children as part of its operations The outcome of the entity s child safety risk assessment e.g. the overarching risk rating identified in Requirement 1 and actions taken to mitigate these risks Information on whether the entity is compliant with the Framework and any measures to improve compliance going forward An outline of any child safety initiatives undertaken in the reporting year, and An outline of any measures taken by the entity to apply child safety measures to funded third parties. Statements may vary in the level of detail depending on the entity s level of interaction with children, i.e. entities with a high level of interaction with children should provide more information. Entities with higher levels of interaction with children should also consider including details on child safety training completed in the reporting period, information on any reviews or updates of child safety related policies and procedures, and information on any relevant consultations with children, their families, carers and communities. Publishing the annual statement The annual statement can be published through any means suited to the publishing entity, provided it is publically available and published in line with the annual reporting cycle that is, by 31 October each year . For example, entities could include the statement in their Annual Report or as a standalone statement on their website. Entities must inform the National Office for Child Safety once their annual child safety statement has been published, and provide a copy or link to the statement by email to commonwealthchildsafe pmc.gov.au. 12 Requirement 1, outlined in 2.1 of the Framework, requires entities to conduct an annual risk assessment.
