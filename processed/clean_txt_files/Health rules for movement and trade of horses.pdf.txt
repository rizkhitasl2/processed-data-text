IV Acts adopted before 1 December 2009 under the EC Treaty, the EU Treaty and the Euratom Treaty COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2009 156 EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing the movement and importation from third countries of equidae codified version Text with EEA relevance THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament 1 , Whereas 1 Council Directive 90 426 EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae 2 has been substantially amended several times 3 . In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified. 2 Equidae, being live animals, are included in the list of products in Annex I to the Treaty. 3 In order to ensure the rational development of equidae production, thereby increasing productivity in that sector, rules governing the movement of equidae between Member States should be laid down at Community level. 4 The breeding and rearing of equidae, and in particular of horses, is generally included in the farming sector. It constitutes a source of income for part of the farming population. 5 Disparities as regards animal health conditions in the Member States should be eliminated in order to encourage intra Community trade in equidae. 6 In order to encourage the harmonious development of intra Community trade, a Community system should be provided for to govern imports from third countries. 7 The conditions for the movement on national territory of registered equidae bearing an identification document should also be regulated. 8 In order to be the subject of trade, equidae should satisfy certain animal health requirements, so as to avoid the spreading of infectious or contagious diseases. It appears in particular appropriate to provide for a possible regionalisation of restrictive measures. 9 The transport conditions should be laid down for the same reasons, taking into account the animal welfare conditions laid down in Council Regulation EC No 1 2005 of 22 December 2004 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations 4 . 10 To ensure that those requirements are satisfied, provision should be made for the issue by an official veterinarian of a health certificate to accompany the equidae to their place of destination. 11 The organisation of and the follow up to the checks to be carried out by the Member State of destination and the safeguard measures to be implemented have been laid down in Council Directive 90 425 EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market 5 . EN 23.7.2010 Official Journal of the European Union L 192 1 1 Opinion of 22 April 2009 not yet published in the Official Journal . 2 OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 42. 3 See Annex V, Part A. 4 OJ L 3, 5.1.2005, p. 1. 5 OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 29.   12 Provision should be made for the possibility of checks by the Commission. These checks should be carried out in cooperation with the competent national authorities. 13 Defining Community provisions applicable to imports from third countries requires a list to be drawn up of third countries or parts of third countries from which equidae may be imported. 14 The choice of those countries should be based on criteria of a general nature such as the state of health of the livestock, the organisation and powers of the veterinary services and the health regulations in force. 15 In addition, imports of equidae should not be authorised from countries infected with infectious or contagious animal diseases which present a risk to Community livestock or which have been free from such infection for too short a period. Such considerations are also valid for imports from third countries in which vaccination against such diseases is carried out. 16 The general conditions applicable to imports from third countries should be supplemented by special conditions drawn up on the basis of the health situation in each of them. The technical nature and the diversity of the criteria on which those special conditions depend require for their definition recourse to a flexible and rapid Community procedure in which the Commission and the Member States cooperate closely. 17 The presentation of a common standard form of certificate upon import of equidae constitutes an effective means of verifying that the Community rules are being applied. Such rules may include special provisions which may vary according to the third country concerned, and this should be taken into account in drawing up the standard forms of certificates. 18 Veterinary experts of the Commission and of the Member States, appointed by the Commission, should be responsible for verifying that the requirements of this Directive are observed, particularly in third countries. 19 The checks carried out upon importation should cover the origin and the state of health of the equidae. 20 The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999 468 EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission 1 . 21 This Directive is without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for trans position into national law of the Directives set out in Annex V, Part B, HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 This Directive lays down animal health conditions for the movement between Member States and importation from third countries of live equidae.

CHAPTER II RULES FOR THE MOVEMENT OF EQUIDAE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES Article 3 Member States shall authorise the movement of registered equidae in their territory or send equidae to another Member State only where they satisfy the conditions laid down in Articles 4 and 5. However, the competent authorities in Member States of desti nation may grant general or limited exemption in respect of movement of equidae which are being ridden or taken, for sporting or recreational purposes, along roads situated near internal borders of the Community, are taking part in cultural or similar events or in activities organised by authorised local bodies situated near internal borders of the Community, are intended solely for temporary pasturing or work near internal borders of the Community, Member States making use of such authorisation shall inform the Commission of the content of the exemptions granted. Article 4 1. Equidae must show no clinical sign of disease at inspection. Inspection must be carried out in the 48 hours prior to their embarkation or loading. In the case of registered equidae, however, this inspection shall, without prejudice to Article 6, be required for intra Community trade only. 2. Without prejudice to the requirements of paragraph 5 regarding compulsorily notifiable diseases, the official veterinarian must, at the time of inspection, be satisfied that there are no grounds in particular on the basis of decla rations by the owner or breeder for concluding that the equidae have been in contact with equidae suffering from an infectious or contagious disease during the 15 days immediately preceding inspection. 3. The equidae must not be intended for slaughter under a national programme of infectious or contagious disease eradi cation. 4. The equidae must be identified in the following manner a in the case of registered equidae, by means of an identifi cation document, as provided for in Directive 90 427 EEC, which must certify in particular that paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Article and Article 5 of this Directive have been complied with. The official veterinarian must suspend the validity of the identification document for the period of the prohibitions provided for in paragraph 5 of this Article or in Article 5 of this Directive.

The Commission shall examine the programmes presented by the Member States. Where appropriate, it shall approve them in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 21 2 . Any additional guarantees, general or specific, which may be required in intra Community trade may be defined in accordance with the same procedure. Such guarantees must not exceed those required by the Member State in its own territory. Programmes submitted by Member States may be amended or supplemented in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 21 3 . Amendments or additions to programmes which have already been approved or to guarantees which have been defined in accordance with the second subparagraph may be approved under the same procedure. Article 5 1. A Member State which is not free from African horse sickness may dispatch equidae from that part of its territory which is considered to be infected within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article only under the conditions set out in paragraph 5. 2. A part of the territory of a Member State shall be considered to be infected with African horse sickness if a clinical, serological in unvaccinated animals and or epidemiological evidence has revealed the presence of African horse sickness in the past two years or b vaccination against African horse sickness has been carried out in the past 12 months. EN L 192 4 Official Journal of the European Union 23.7.2010  The part of the territory considered to be infected with African horse sickness shall comprise as a minimum a a protection zone with a radius of at least 100 km around any centre of infection b a surveillance zone of at least 50 km extending beyond the protection zone, in which no vaccination has been carried out in the last 12 months. 3. The control rules and the measures to combat African horse sickness relating to the territories and zones referred to in paragraph 2 and the relevant derogations are specified in Council Directive 92 35 EEC of 29 April 1992 laying down control rules and measures to combat African horse sickness 1 . 4. All vaccinated equidae found in the protection zone must be registered and marked in accordance with Article 6 1 d of Directive 92 35 EEC. The identification document and or health certificate shall carry a clear reference to such vaccination. 5. A Member State may dispatch from the territory referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 only equidae which meet the following requirements a they must be dispatched only during certain periods of the year, having regard to the activity of vector insects, to be determined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 21 3 b they must show no clinical symptom of African horse sickness on the day of the inspection referred to in Article 4 1 c they must have undergone a test for African horse sickness as described in Annex IV, on two occasions, with an interval of between 21 and 30 days between the two tests, the second of which must have been carried out during the 10 days prior to dispatch either i with negative results, if they have not been vaccinated against African horse sickness or ii without having recorded an increase in the antibody count and without having undergone vaccination during the previous two months, if they have been vaccinated against African horse sickness. In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 21 2 , and following the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, other monitoring methods may be recognised d they must have been kept in a quarantine station for a minimum period of 40 days prior to dispatch e they must have been protected from vector insects during the period of quarantine and during transportation from the quarantine station to the place of dispatch. Article 6 Member States which implement an alternative control system providing guarantees equivalent to those laid down in Article 4 5 as regards movements within their territory of equidae may grant one another derogations from the provisions of the second sentence of Article 4 1 and Article 8 1 b on a reciprocal basis. They shall notify the Commission thereof. Article 7 1. Equidae must be transported, as soon as possible, from the holding of origin either directly or via an approved marshalling centre, as defined as assembly centre in Article 2 2 o of Council Directive 64 432 EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra Community trade in bovine animals and swine 2 , to the place of destination in vehicles or containers which have been regularly cleansed and disinfected with a disinfectant at intervals to be fixed by the Member State of dispatch. The vehicles must be designed in such a way that equidae droppings, litter or fodder cannot escape from the vehicle during transportation. Without prejudice to Regulation EC No 1 2005, transportation must be effected in such a way that the health and well being of the equidae can be protected effectively. 2. The Member State of destination may, on a general or restricted basis, grant a derogation from some of the requirements of Article 4 5 for any animal bearing a special mark indicating that it is scheduled for slaughter, provided that the health certificate in accordance with Annex III mentions such derogation. Where such derogation is granted, equidae for slaughter must be transported directly to the designated slaughterhouse and be slaughtered within five days of arrival at the slaughterhouse. 3. The official veterinarian must record the identification number or identification document number of the slaughtered animal and forward to the competent authority of the place of dispatch, at the latter s request, an attestation to the effect that the animal has been slaughtered.

The broad spectrum, polyclonal, immune anti AHSV guinea pig serum hereinafter referred to as guinea pig antiserum is serogroup specific and is able to detect all known serotypes of AHS virus. The principle of the test is the interruption of the reaction between AHSV antigen and a guinea pig antiserum by a test serum sample. AHSV antibodies in the test serum sample will compete with those in the guinea pig antiserum resulting in a reduction in the expected colour following the addition of enzyme labelled anti guinea pig antibody and substrate . Sera can be tested at a single dilution of 1 in 5 spot test method or may be titrated serum titration method to give dilution end points. Inhibition values higher than 50 may be regarded as positive. The test protocol described hereinafter is used in the Regional Reference Laboratory for African horse sickness in Pirbright, United Kingdom. 1.1. Test procedure 1.1.1. Preparation of plates 1.1.1.1. Coat ELISA plates with AHSV antigen extracted from infected cell cultures and diluted in carbonate bicarbonate buffer, pH 9,6. Incubate the ELISA plates overnight at 4 C. 1.1.1.2. Wash plates three times by flooding and emptying the wells with phosphate buffered saline PBS , pH 7, 2 to 7,4 pH, and blot dry on adsorbent paper. 1.1.2. Control wells 1.1.2.1. Titrate the positive control sera in a twofold dilution series, from 1 in 5 to 1 in 640, across column 1 in blocking buffer PBS containing 0,05 v v Tween 20, 5,0 w v skimmed milk powder Cadbury s Marvel TM and 1 v v adult bovine serum to give a final volume of 50 μl well. 1.1.2.2. Add 50 μl of the negative control serum at a dilution of 1 in 5 10 μl serum 40 μl blocking buffer to wells A and B of column 2. 1.1.2.3. Add 100 μl well of blocking buffer to wells C and D of column 2 blank . 1.1.2.4. Add 50 μl of blocking buffer to wells E, F, G and H of column 2 guinea pig control . 1.1.3. Spot test method 1.1.3.1. Add a 1 in 5 dilution of each test serum in blocking buffer to duplicate wells of columns 3 to 12 10 μl sera 40 μl blocking buffer . or EN L 192 16 Official Journal of the European Union 23.7.2010  1.1.4. Serum titration method 1.1.4.1. Prepare a twofold dilution series of each test sample 1 in 5 to 1 in 640 in blocking buffer across eight wells of single columns 3 to 12 . then 1.1.5. Add 50 μl of guinea pig antisera, pre diluted in blocking buffer, to all wells except the blank wells of the ELISA plate all wells now contain a final volume of 100 μl . 1.1.5.1. Incubate for 1 hour at 37 C on an orbital shaker. 1.1.5.2. Wash plates three times and blot dry as before. 1.1.5.3. Add 50 μl of rabbit anti guinea pig horseradish peroxidase HRP conjugate pre diluted in blocking buffer to each well. 1.1.5.4. Incubate for 1 hour at 37 C on an orbital shaker. 1.1.5.5. Wash plates three times and blot dry as before. 1.1.6. Chromogen Prepare the chromogen OPD OPD ortho phenyldiamine solution according to the manufacturers instructions 0,4 mg ml in sterile distilled water just before use. Add substrate hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2 to give a final concentration of 0,05 v v 1 in 2000 of a 30 solution of H 2 O 2 . Add 50 μl of the OPD solution to each well and leave plates on the bench for 10 minutes at ambient temperature. Stop the reaction by the addition of 50 μl well of 1M sulphuric acid H 2 SO 4 . 1.1.7. Reading Read spectrophotometrically at 492 nm. 1.2. Expression of results 1.2.1. Using a software package print out the optical density OD values, and the percentage inhibition PI for test and control sera based on the mean value recorded in the four guinea pig control wells. The data expressed as OD and PI values are used to determine whether the test has performed within acceptable limits. The upper control limits UCL and lower control limits LCL for the guinea pig control are between OD values 1,4 and 0,4 respectively. The end point titre for the positive control based on 50 PI should be 1 in 240 within a range from 1 in 120 to 1 in 480 . Any plate that fails to conform to the above criteria must be rejected. However, if the positive control serum titre is greater than 1 in 480 and the test samples are still negative then the negative test samples can be accepted. The duplicate negative control serum wells and the duplicate blank wells should record PI values between 25 and 25 , and between 95 and 105 , respectively. Failure to be within these limits does not invalidate the plate but does suggest that background colour is developing. 1.2.2. The diagnostic threshold cut off value for test sera is 50 PI 50 . Samples recording PI values greater than 50 are recorded as positive. Samples recording PI values lower than 50 are recorded as negative. Samples that record PI values above and below the threshold for the duplicate wells are considered doubtful. Such samples may be re tested in the spot test and by titration. Positive samples may also be titrated to provide an indication of the degree of positivity.

BLOCKING ELISA FOR THE DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES TO AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS VIRUS AHSV PRESCRIBED TEST The blocking ELISA is designed to detect specific AHSV antibodies in sera from any susceptible species. VP7 is the major, antigenic, viral protein of AHSV, and is conserved within the nine serotypes. Because the monoclonal antibody Mab is also directed against the VP7, the assay will give a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Further, the recombinant VP7 antigen is completely innocuous and therefore guarantees a high degree of safety. The principal of the test is the interruption of the reaction between the recombinant VP7, as the antigen bound to the ELISA plate and the conjugated Mab specific for the VP7. Antibody in the test sera will block the reaction between the antigen and the Mab resulting in a reduction in colour. The test described hereinafter is carried out in the European Community Reference Laboratory for African horse sickness in Algete, Spain. 3.1. Test procedure 3.1.1. ELISA plates 3.1.1.1. Coat ELISA plates with recombinant AHSV 4 VP7 diluted in carbonate bicarbonate buffer, pH 9,6. Incubate overnight at 4 C. 3.1.1.2. Wash the plates five times with phosphate buffered saline PBS containing 0,05 v v Tween 20 PBST . 3.1.1.3. Stabilise the plate by treatment with a stabilising solution in order to allow long term storage at 4 C without loss of activity and blot dry onto absorbent material. 3.1.2. Test samples and controls 3.1.2.1. For screening dilute test sera and controls 1 in 10 directly on the plate in PBST to give a final volume 100 μl well. Incubate for 1 hour at 37 C. 3.1.2.2.
