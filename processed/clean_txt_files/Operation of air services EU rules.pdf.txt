REGULATION EC No 1008 2008 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 24 September 2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community Recast Text with EEA relevance THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu nity, and in particular Article 80 2 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 , Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 2 , Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty 3 , Whereas 1 A number of substantial changes are to be made to Council Regulations EEC No 2407 92 of 23 July 1992 on licensing of air carriers 4 , EEC No 2408 92 of 23 July 1992 on access of Community air carriers to intra Community air routes 5 , and EEC No 2409 92 of 23 July 1992 on fares and rates for air services 6 . In the interests of clarity, these Regulations should be recast and consolidated into one single Regulation. 2 In order to ensure a more efficient and consistent application of Community legislation for the internal aviation market a series of adjustments to the current legal framework is required. 3 Recognising the potential link between the financial health of an air carrier and safety, more stringent monitoring of the financial situation of air carriers should be established. 4 Given the growing importance of air carriers with operational bases in several Member States and the need to ensure the efficient supervision of these air carriers, the same Member State should be responsible for the oversight of the air operator certificate and of the operating licence. 5 To ensure consistent monitoring of the compliance with the requirements of the operating licences of all Commu nity air carriers, licensing authorities should carry out regular assessments of the air carriers financial situation. Therefore, the latter should provide sufficient information on their financial situation, especially in the first two years of their existence as these are particularly critical for the survival of an air carrier on the market. In order to avoid a distortion of competition arising from the different application of the rules at national level, it is necessary to reinforce the financial oversight of all Community air carriers by Member States. 6 To reduce risks to passengers, Community air carriers failing to fulfil the requirements for maintaining a valid operating licence should not be allowed to continue operations. In such cases, the competent licensing authority should revoke or suspend the operating licence. 7 According to Regulation EC No 785 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators 7 an air carrier should be insured to cover liability in case of accidents with respect to passengers, cargo and third parties. Obligations should also be placed upon air carriers for insurance to cover liability in case of accidents with respect to mail. 8 In order to avoid excessive recourse to lease agreements of aircraft registered in third countries, especially wet lease, these possibilities should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, such as a lack of adequate aircraft on the Community market, and they should be strictly limited in time and fulfil safety standards equivalent to the safety rules of Community and national legislation. 9 With respect to employees of a Community air carrier operating air services from an operational base outside the territory of the Member State where that Community air 31.10.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 293 3 1 OJ C 175, 27.7.2007, p. 85. 2 OJ C 305, 15.12.2007, p. 11. 3 Opinion of European Parliament of 11 July 2007 OJ C 175 E, 10.7.2008, p. 371 , Council Common Position of 18 April 2008 OJ C 129 E, 27.5.2008, p. 1 and Position of the European Parliament of 9 July 2008 not yet published in the Official Journal . 4 OJ L 240, 24.8.1992, p. 1. 5 OJ L 240, 24.8.1992, p. 8. 6 OJ L 240, 24.8.1992, p. 15. 7 OJ L 138, 30.4.2004, p. 1.  carrier has its principal place of business, Member States should ensure the proper application of Community and national social legislation. 10 In order to complete the internal aviation market, still existing restrictions applied between Member States, such as restrictions on the code sharing on routes to third countries or on the price setting on routes to third countries with an intermediate stop in another Member State sixth freedom flights should be lifted. 11 To take into account the special characteristics and constraints of the outermost regions, in particular their remoteness, insularity and small size, and the need to properly link them with the central regions of the Community, special arrangements may be justified regard ing the rules on the period of validity of the contracts for public service obligations covering routes to such regions. 12 The conditions under which public service obligations may be imposed should be defined clearly in an unambiguous way, while the associated tender procedures should allow a sufficient number of competitors to take part in the tenders. The Commission should be able to obtain as much information as necessary to be able to assess the economic justifications for public service obligations in individual cases. 13 The rules in force with regard to traffic distribution between airports serving the same city or conurbation should be clarified and simplified. 14 It is appropriate to ensure that Member States have the possibility to react to sudden problems resulting from unforeseeable and unavoidable circumstances, which make it technically or practically very difficult to carry out air services. 15 Customers should have access to all air fares and air rates irrespective of their place of residence within the Commu nity or their nationality and irrespective of the place of establishment of the travel agents within the Community. 16 Customers should be able to compare effectively the prices for air services of different airlines. Therefore the final price to be paid by the customer for air services originating in the Community should at all times be indicated, inclusive of all taxes, charges and fees. Community air carriers are also encouraged to indicate the final price for their air services from third countries to the Community. 17 The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999 468 EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission 1 . 18 Since the objective of this Regulation, namely more homogeneous application of Community legislation with regard to the internal aviation market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the international character of air transport, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. 19 The Ministerial Statement on Gibraltar Airport, agreed in Cordoba on 18 September 2006, during the first ministerial meeting of the Forum of Dialogue on Gibraltar, will replace the Joint Declaration on the airport made in London on 2 December 1987, and full compliance with it will be deemed to constitute compliance with the 1987 declaration. 20 It is therefore necessary to repeal Regulations EEC No 2407 92, EEC No 2408 92 and EEC No 2409 92, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Subject matter 1.

During the first two years of operation of a Community air carrier, the data as referred to in point 3 of Annex I shall be made available to the competent licensing authority upon request. The competent licensing authority may at any time assess the financial performance of a Community air carrier to which it has granted an operating licence by requesting the relevant information. As part of such an assessment, the Community air carrier in question shall update the data referred to in point 3 of Annex I and provide it to the competent licensing authority upon request. 5. A Community air carrier shall notify the competent licensing authority a in advance of any plans for the operation of a new air service to a continent or a world region not previously served, or any other substantial change in the scale of its activities, including, but not limited to, changes in the type or number of aircraft used b in advance of any intended mergers or acquisitions and c within 14 days of any change in the ownership of any single shareholding which represents 10 or more of the total shareholding of the Community air carrier or of its parent or ultimate holding company. 6.

Nevertheless, the competent licensing authority may grant a temporary licence, not exceeding 12 months pending financial reorganisation of a Community air carrier provided that safety is not at risk, that this temporary licence reflects, when appropriate, any changes to the AOC, and that there is a realistic prospect of a satisfactory financial reconstruction within that time period. 2. Whenever there are clear indications that financial problems exist or when insolvency or similar proceedings are opened against a Community air carrier licensed by it the competent licensing authority shall without delay make an in depth assessment of the financial situation and on the basis of its findings review the status of the operating licence in compliance with this Article within a time period of three months. L 293 8 EN Official Journal of the European Union 31.10.2008  The competent licensing authority shall inform the Commission of its decisions, relating to the status of the operating licence. 3. When the audited accounts referred to in Article 8 4 have not been communicated within the deadline indicated in that Article, the competent licensing authority shall, without undue delay, request the Community air carrier to communicate these audited accounts. If the audited accounts are not communicated within one month, the operating licence may be revoked or suspended. 4. The competent licensing authority shall suspend or revoke the operating licence if the Community air carrier knowingly or recklessly furnishes the competent licensing authority with false information on an important point. 5. In case a Community air carrier s AOC is suspended or withdrawn, the competent licensing authority shall immediately suspend or revoke that air carrier s operating licence. 6.

The decision shall be communicated to the applicant. A refusal shall indicate the reasons therefor. 2. Procedures for granting, suspending and revoking operating licences shall be made public by the competent licensing authorities, which shall inform the Commission thereof. 3. A list of decisions of the competent licensing authorities to grant, suspend or revoke operating licences shall be published annually in the Official Journal of the European Union. Article 11 Insurance requirements Notwithstanding Regulation EC No 785 2004, an air carrier shall be insured to cover liability in case of accidents with respect to mail. Article 12 Registration 1. Without prejudice to Article 13 3 , aircraft used by a Community air carrier shall be registered, at the option of the Member State whose competent authority issues the operating licence, in its national register or within the Community. 2. In accordance with paragraph 1, the competent authority shall, subject to applicable laws and regulations, accept on its national register, without any discriminatory fee and without delay, aircraft owned by nationals of other Member States and transfers from aircraft registers of other Member States. No fee shall be applied to transfers of aircraft in addition to the normal registration fee. Article 13 Leasing 1. Without prejudice to Article 4 c , a Community air carrier may have one or more aircraft at its disposal through dry or wet lease agreement. Community air carriers may freely operate wet leased aircraft registered within the Community except where this would lead to endangering safety. The Commission shall ensure that the implementation of such a provision is reasonable and proportionate and based on safety considerations. 2. A dry lease agreement to which a Community air carrier is a party or a wet lease agreement under which the Community air carrier is the lessee of the wet leased aircraft shall be subject to prior approval in accordance with applicable Community or national law on aviation safety. 3. A Community air carrier wet leasing aircraft registered in a third country from another undertaking shall obtain prior approval for the operation from the competent licensing authority. The competent authority may grant an approval if a the Community air carrier demonstrates to the satisfaction of the competent authority that all safety standards equivalent to those imposed by Community or national law are met and b one of the following conditions is fulfilled i the Community air carrier justifies such leasing on the basis of exceptional needs, in which case an approval may be granted for a period of up to seven months that may be renewed once for a further period of up to seven months 31.10.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 293 9   ii the Community air carrier demonstrates that the leasing is necessary to satisfy seasonal capacity needs, which cannot reasonably be satisfied through leasing aircraft registered within the Community, in which case the approval may be renewed or iii the Community air carrier demonstrates that the leasing is necessary to overcome operational difficul ties and it is not possible or reasonable to lease aircraft registered within the Community, in which case the approval shall be of limited duration strictly necessary for overcoming the difficulties. 4. The competent authority may attach conditions to the approval. Such conditions shall form part of the wet lease agreement. The competent authority may refuse to grant an approval if there is no reciprocity as regards wet leasing between the Member State concerned or the Community and the third country where the wet leased aircraft is registered. The competent authority shall inform the Member States concerned about an approval it has granted for wet leasing aircraft registered in a third country. Article 14 Right to be heard The competent licensing authority shall ensure that, when adopting a decision to suspend or revoke the operating licence of a Community air carrier, the Community air carrier concerned is given the opportunity of being heard, taking into account the need, in some cases, for an urgency procedure. CHAPTER III ACCESS TO ROUTES Article 15 Provision of intra Community air services 1. Community air carriers shall be entitled to operate intra Community air services. 2. Member States shall not subject the operation of intra Community air services by a Community air carrier to any permit or authorisation. Member States shall not require Community air carriers to provide any documents or informa tion which they have already supplied to the competent licensing authority, provided that the relevant information may be obtained from the competent licensing authority in due time. 3. If the Commission, on the basis of information obtained under Article 26 2 , finds that the operating licence granted to a Community air carrier is not in compliance with the require ments of this Regulation it shall forward its findings to the competent licensing authority which shall send its comments to the Commission within 15 working days. If the Commission, after examining the comments of the competent licensing authority, maintains that the operating licence is not compliant, or no comments have been received from the competent licensing authority it shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 25 2 , take a decision to request the competent licensing authority to take the appropriate corrective measures or to suspend or revoke the operating licence. The decision shall set a date by which the corrective measures or actions by the competent licensing authority shall be imple mented. If the corrective measures or actions have not been implemented by that date the Community air carrier shall not be entitled to exercise its rights under paragraph 1. The Community air carrier may resume exercising its rights under paragraph 1 upon notification to the Commission by the competent licensing authority that the corrective measures have been implemented and that the competent licensing authority has verified the implementation. 4. When operating intra Community air services, a Commu nity air carrier shall be permitted to combine air services and to enter into code share arrangements, without prejudice to the Community competition rules applicable to undertakings. Any restrictions on the freedom of Community air carriers to operate intra Community air services arising from bilateral agreements between Member States are hereby superseded. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of bilateral agreements between Member States, and subject to the Community competition rules applicable to undertakings, Community air carriers shall be permitted by the Member State s concerned to combine air services and to enter into code share arrangements with any air carrier on air services to, from or via any airport in their territory from or to any point s in third countries. A Member State may, in the framework of the bilateral air service agreement with the third country concerned, impose restrictions on code share arrangements between Community air carriers and air carriers of a third country, in particular if the third country concerned does not allow similar commercial opportu nities to Community air carriers operating from the Member L 293 10 EN Official Journal of the European Union 31.10.2008  State concerned. In doing so, Member States shall ensure that restrictions imposed under such agreements do not restrict competition and are non discriminatory between Community air carriers and that they are not more restrictive than necessary. Article 16 General principles for public service obligations 1. A Member State, following consultations with the other Member States concerned and after having informed the Commission, the airports concerned and air carriers operating on the route, may impose a public service obligation in respect of scheduled air services between an airport in the Community and an airport serving a peripheral or development region in its territory or on a thin route to any airport on its territory any such route being considered vital for the economic and social development of the region which the airport serves. That obligation shall be imposed only to the extent necessary to ensure on that route the minimum provision of scheduled air services satisfying fixed standards of continuity, regularity, pricing or minimum capacity, which air carriers would not assume if they were solely considering their commercial interest. The fixed standards imposed on the route subject to that public service obligation shall be set in a transparent and non discriminatory way. 2. In instances where other modes of transport cannot ensure an uninterrupted service with at least two daily frequencies, the Member States concerned may include in the public service obligation the requirement that any Community air carrier intending to operate the route gives a guarantee that it will operate the route for a certain period, to be specified, in accordance with the other terms of the public service obligation. 3. The necessity and the adequacy of an envisaged public service obligation shall be assessed by the Member State s having regard to a the proportionality between the envisaged obligation and the economic development needs of the region concerned b the possibility of having recourse to other modes of transport and the ability of such modes to meet the transport needs under consideration, in particular when existing rail services serve the envisaged route with a travel time of less than three hours and with sufficient frequencies, connections and suitable timings c the air fares and conditions which can be quoted to users d the combined effect of all air carriers operating or intending to operate on the route. 4. When a Member State wishes to impose a public service obligation, it shall communicate the text of the envisaged imposition of the public service obligation to the Commission, to the other Member States concerned, to the airports concerned and to the air carriers operating the route in question. The Commission shall publish an information notice in the Official Journal of the European Union a identifying the two airports connected by the route concerned and possible intermediate stop over point s b mentioning the date of entry into force of the public service obligation and c indicating the complete address where the text and any relevant information and or documentation related to the public service obligation shall be made available without delay and free of charge by the Member State concerned. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 4, with respect to routes where the number of passengers expected to use the air service is less than 10 000 per annum, the information notice on a public service obligation shall be published either in the Official Journal of the European Union or in the national official journal of the Member State concerned. 6. The date of entry into force of a public service obligation shall not be earlier than the date of publication of the information notice referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4. 7. When a public service obligation has been imposed in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 the Community air carrier shall be able to offer seat only sales provided that the air service in question meets all the requirements of the public service obligation. Consequently that air service shall be considered as a scheduled air service. 8. When a public service obligation has been imposed in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, any other Community air carrier shall at any time be allowed to commence scheduled air services meeting all the requirements of the public service obligation, including the period of operation that may be required in accordance with paragraph 2. 9. Notwithstanding paragraph 8, if no Community air carrier has commenced or can demonstrate that it is about to commence sustainable scheduled air services on a route in accordance with the public service obligation which has been 31.10.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 293 11  imposed on that route, the Member State concerned may limit access to the scheduled air services on that route to only one Community air carrier for a period of up to four years, after which the situation shall be reviewed. This period may be up to five years if the public service obligation is imposed on a route to an airport serving an outermost region, referred to in Article 299 2 of the Treaty. 10. The right to operate the services referred to in paragraph 9 shall be offered by public tender in accordance with Article 17, either singly or, in cases where justified for reasons of operational efficiency, for a group of such routes to any Community air carrier entitled to operate such air services. For reasons of administrative efficiency, a Member State may issue a single invitation to tender covering different routes. 11. A public service obligation shall be deemed to have expired if no scheduled air service has been operated during a period of 12 months on the route subject to such obligation. 12. In case of sudden interruption of service by the Community air carrier selected in accordance with Article 17, the Member State concerned may, in case of emergency, select by mutual agreement a different Community air carrier to operate the public service obligation for a period up to seven months, not renewable, under the following conditions a any compensation paid by the Member State shall be made in compliance with Article 17 8 b the selection shall be made among Community air carriers in compliance with the principles of transparency and non discrimination c a new call for tender shall be launched. The Commission and the Member State s concerned shall be informed without delay of the emergency procedure and of its reasons. At the request of a Member State, or on its own initiative, the Commission may, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 25 2 suspend the procedure if it considers after its assessment that it does not meet the requirements of this paragraph or is otherwise contrary to Community law.
