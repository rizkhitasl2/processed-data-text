REGULATION EU No 1380 2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 11 December 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council Regulations EC No 1954 2003 and EC No 1224 2009 and repealing Council Regulations EC No 2371 2002 and EC No 639 2004 and Council Decision 2004 585 EC THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43 2 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 , Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 2 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 3 , Whereas 1 Council Regulation EC No 2371 2002 4 established a Community system for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy CFP . 2 The scope of the CFP includes the conservation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries targeting them. In addition, it includes, in relation to market measures and financial measures in support of its objectives, fresh water biological resources and aqua culture activities, as well as the processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products, where such activities take place on the territory of Member States or in Union waters, including by fishing vessels flying the flag of, and registered in, third countries, by Union fishing vessels, or by nationals of Member States, without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the flag State, bearing in mind the provisions of Article 117 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 5 UNCLOS . 3 Recreational fisheries can have a significant impact on fish resources and Member States should, therefore, ensure that they are conducted in a manner that is compatible with the objectives of the CFP. 4 The CFP should ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities contribute to long term environmental, economic, and social sustainability. It should include rules that aim to ensure the traceability, security and quality of products marketed in the Union. Furthermore, the CFP should contribute to increased productivity, to a fair standard of living for the fisheries sector including small scale fisheries, and to stable markets, and it should ensure the availability of food supplies and that they reach consumers at reasonable prices. The CFP should contribute to the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and should help to achieve the objectives set out therein. 5 The Union is a contracting party to UNCLOS 6 and, pursuant to Council Decision 98 414 EC 7 , to the United Nations Agreement on the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks of 4 December 1995 8 UN Fish Stocks Agreement and, pursuant to Council Decision 96 428 EC 9 , to the Agreement to EN L 354 22 Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2013 1 OJ C 181, 21.6.2012, p. 183. 2 OJ C 225, 27.7.2012, p. 20. 3 Position of the European Parliament of 6 February 2013 not yet published in the Official Journal and position of the Council at first reading of 17 October 2013 not yet published in the Official Journal .

The CFP should, therefore, contribute to the Union s implementation of its inter national obligations under those international instru ments. Where Member States adopt conservation and management measures, for which they have been empowered within the framework of the CFP, they should also act in a manner which is fully consistent with the international obligations regarding conservation and cooperation under those international instruments. 7 At the World Summit on Sustainable Development at Johannesburg in 2002, the Union and its Member States committed themselves to act against the continued decline of many fish stocks. Therefore, the Union should improve the CFP by adapting exploitation rates so as to ensure that, within a reasonable time frame, the exploitation of marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested stocks above levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield. The exploitation rates should be achieved by 2015. Achieving those exploitation rates by a later date should be allowed only if achieving them by 2015 would seriously jeopardise the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleets involved. After 2015, those rates should be achieved as soon as possible and in any event no later than 2020. Where scientific information is insufficient to determine those levels, approximative parameters may be considered. 8 Management decisions relating to maximum sustainable yield in mixed fisheries should take into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery at maximum sustainable yield at the same time, in particular where scientific advice indicates that it is very difficult to avoid the phenomenon of choke species by increasing the selectivity of the fishing gears used. Appro priate scientific bodies should be requested to provide advice on the appropriate fishing mortality levels in such circumstances. 9 The CFP should ensure coherence with the fisheries targets laid down in the Decision by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity on the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 2020, and with the biodiversity targets adopted by the European Council of 25 and 26 March 2010. 10 Sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources should be based on the precautionary approach, which derives from the precautionary principle referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 191 2 of the Treaty, taking into account available scientific data. 11 The CFP should contribute to the protection of the marine environment, to the sustainable management of all commercially exploited species, and in particular to the achievement of good environmental status by 2020, as set out in Article 1 1 of Directive 2008 56 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 2 . 12 The CFP should also contribute to the supplying of highly nutritional food to the Union market and to reducing the Union market s dependence on food imports. It should also foster direct and indirect job creation and economic development in coastal areas. 13 An ecosystem based approach to fisheries management needs to be implemented, environmental impacts of fishing activities should be limited and unwanted catches should be avoided and reduced as far as possible. 14 It is important for the management of the CFP to be guided by principles of good governance. Those prin ciples include decision making based on best available scientific advice, broad stakeholder involvement and a long term perspective. The successful management of the CFP also depends on a clear definition of responsi bilities at Union, regional, national and local levels and on the mutual compatibility of the measures taken and their consistency with other Union policies. 15 The CFP should contribute to the improvement of safety and working conditions for fishing operators. 16 The CFP should pay full regard, where relevant, to animal health, animal welfare, food and feed safety. EN 28.12.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 354 23 1 Agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas OJ L 177, 16.7.1996, p. 26 . 2 Directive 2008 56 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy Marine Strategy Framework Directive OJ L 164, 25.6.2008, p. 19 .   17 Since all matters related to Europe s oceans and seas are interlinked, the CFP should be implemented in a way that is consistent with other Union policies and, in particular, that takes into account interactions with Union actions in other maritime policy areas. Coherence should be ensured in the management of different sectoral policies within the Baltic Sea, North Sea, Celtic seas, Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast, Mediterranean and Black Sea sea basins. 18 Union fishing vessels should have equal access to Union waters and resources subject to the rules of the CFP. 19 Existing rules restricting access to resources within the 12 nautical mile zones of Member States have operated satisfactorily, benefiting conservation by restricting fishing effort in the most sensitive part of Union waters. Those rules have also preserved the traditional fishing activities on which the social and economic devel opment of certain coastal communities is highly dependent. Those rules should therefore continue to apply. Member States should endeavour to give prefer ential access for small scale, artisanal or coastal fishermen. 20 Small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should, where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper. 21 Marine biological resources around the Union outermost regions referred to in the first paragraph of Article 349 of the Treaty should be especially protected since they contribute to the preservation of the local economy of those territories, having regard to their structural, social and economic situation. Certain fishing activities in those waters should therefore be limited to fishing vessels registered in the ports of those territories. 22 In order to contribute to the conservation of living aquatic resources and marine ecosystems, the Union should endeavour to protect areas that are biologically sensitive, by designating them as protected areas. In such areas, it should be possible to restrict or to prohibit fishing activities. When deciding which areas to designate, particular attention should be paid to those in which there is clear evidence of heavy concentrations of fish below minimum conservation reference size and of spawning grounds, and to areas which are deemed to be bio geographically sensitive. Account should also be taken of existing conservation areas. In order to facilitate the designation process, Member States should identify suitable areas, including areas that form part of a coherent network, and, where appropriate, should cooperate with one another, preparing and sending joint recommendations to the Commission. In order to establish protected areas more effectively, it should be possible for the Commission to be empowered to establish them in a multiannual plan. In order to ensure a suitable level of democratic accountability and control, the Commission should regularly report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the func tioning of those protected areas. 23 The objective of sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources is more effectively achieved through a multiannual approach to fisheries management, establishing as a priority multiannual plans reflecting the specificities of different fisheries. 24 Multiannual plans should, where possible, cover multiple stocks where those stocks are jointly exploited. The multiannual plans should establish the framework for the sustainable exploitation of stocks and marine ecosystems concerned, defining clear time frames and safeguard mechanisms for unforeseen developments. Multiannual plans should also be governed by clearly defined management objectives in order to contribute to the sustainable exploitation of the stocks and to the protection of the marine ecosystems concerned. Those plans should be adopted in consultation with Advisory Councils, operators in the fishing industry, scientists and other stakeholders having an interest in fisheries management. 25 Directive 2009 147 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 , Council Directive 92 43 EEC 2 and Directive 2008 56 EC impose certain obligations on Member States as regards special protection areas, special areas of conservation and marine protected areas, respectively. Such measures might require the adoption of measures falling under the CFP. It is, therefore, appropriate to authorise Member States to adopt, in the waters under their sovereignty or juris diction, such conservation measures that are necessary to comply with their obligations under those Union acts where such measures do not affect the fisheries interests of other Member States. Where such measures might affect fisheries interests of other Member States, the power to adopt such measures should be granted to the Commission and recourse should be had to regional cooperation among the Member States concerned. 26 Measures are needed to reduce the current high levels of unwanted catches and to gradually eliminate discards. Unwanted catches and discards constitute a substantial waste and negatively affect the sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and marine ecosystems EN L 354 24 Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2013 1 Directive 2009 147 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds OJ L 20, 26.1.2010, p. 7 . 2 Council Directive 92 43 EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7 .  and the financial viability of fisheries. An obligation to land all catches the landing obligation of species which are subject to catch limits and, in the Mediter ranean Sea, also catches of species which are subject to minimum sizes, made during fishing activities in Union waters or by Union fishing vessels should be established and gradually implemented and rules that have so far obliged fishermen to discard should be repealed. 27 The landing obligation should be introduced on a fishery by fishery basis. Fishermen should be allowed to continue discarding species which, according to the best available scientific advice, have a high survival rate when released into the sea. 28 In order to make the landing obligation workable and to mitigate the effect of varying yearly catch compositions, Member States should be allowed to transfer quotas between years, up to a certain percentage. 29 In the management of the landing obligation, it is necessary that Member States do their utmost to reduce unwanted catches. To this end, improvements of selective fishing techniques to avoid and reduce, as far as possible, unwanted catches must have high priority. It is important for Member States to distribute quotas between vessels in a mix that reflects as far as possible the expected composition of species in the fisheries. In the event of a mismatch between available quotas and actual fishing pattern, Member States should consider adjustments through quota swaps with other Member States, including on a permanent basis. Member States should also consider facilitating the pooling by vessel owners of individual quotas, for example at the level of producer organisations or groups of vessel owners. Ultimately, Member States should consider counting by catch species against the quota of the target species, depending on the conservation status of the by catch species. 30 The destination of landings of catches of fish under the minimum conservation reference size should be limited and should exclude sale for human consumption. 31 In order to cater for unwanted catches that are unavoidable even when all the measures for their reduction are applied, certain de minimis exemptions from the landing obligation should be established for the fisheries to which the landing obligation applies, primarily through multiannual plans. 32 Subject to scientific advice and without jeopardising the objectives of maximum sustainable yield or increasing fishing mortality, where the landing obligation, including the obligation to document catches, applies, an increase of related fishing opportunities should be possible, in order to take into account the fact that fish previously discarded will be landed. 33 Access to a fishery should be based on transparent and objective criteria including those of an environmental, social and economic nature. Member States should promote responsible fishing by providing incentives to those operators who fish in the least environmentally damaging way and who provide the greatest benefits for society. 34 For stocks for which no multiannual plan has been estab lished, exploitation rates delivering maximum sustainable yield should be ensured by setting catch or fishing effort limits. If available data is insufficient, fisheries should be managed by using approximative parameters. 35 In view of the precarious economic state of the fishing industry and the dependence of certain coastal commu nities on fishing, it is necessary to ensure the relative stability of fishing activities by allocating fishing oppor tunities among Member States, based on a predictable share of the stocks for each Member State. 36 Such relative stability of fishing activities, given the temporary biological situation of stocks, should safeguard and take full account of the particular needs of regions where local communities are especially dependent on fisheries and related activities, as decided by the Council in its Resolution of 3 November 1976 1 , and in particular Annex VII thereto. 37 Therefore, it is in this sense that the concept of relative stability should be understood. 38 The Commission should be authorised to adopt temporary measures in the event of a serious threat, requiring immediate action, to the conservation of marine biological resources or to the marine ecosystem resulting from fishing activities. Those measures should be established within defined time frames and should be operational for a fixed period of time. EN 28.12.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 354 25 1 Council resolution of 3 November 1976 on certain external aspects of the creation of a 200 mile fishing zone in the Community with effect from 1 January 1977 OJ C 105, 7.5.1981, p. 1 .   39 Member States should cooperate at regional level in order to adopt joint recommendations and other instruments for the development and implementation of conservation measures and measures affecting fishing activity in areas protected by environmental law. In the framework of regional cooperation, the Commission should only adopt conservation measures through implementing acts or delegated acts where all Member States concerned in a region agree on a joint recommendation. In the absence of a joint recommendation, the Commission should submit a proposal for the relevant measures pursuant to the Treaty. 40 Member States should be empowered to adopt conser vation and management measures for stocks in Union waters applicable solely to Union fishing vessels flying their flag. 41 In their 12 nautical mile zones, Member States should be empowered to adopt conservation and management measures applicable to all Union fishing vessels, provided that, where such measures apply to Union fishing vessels from other Member States, they are non discriminatory, prior consultation of other Member States concerned has taken place and the Union has not adopted measures specifically addressing conservation and management within the 12 nautical mile zone concerned. 42 Member States should be able to introduce a system of transferable fishing concessions. 43 Member States should take specific measures to align the number of Union fishing vessels with available resources, based on their assessments of the balance between the fishing capacity of their fleets and the fishing oppor tunities available to them. The assessments should be made in accordance with Commission guidelines and be presented in an annual report to be transmitted to the Commission. Those reports should be made public. Each Member State should be able to choose the measures and instruments which it wishes to adopt in order to reduce excessive fishing capacity. 44 In addition, compulsory maximum fleet capacity ceilings and national entry exit schemes in relation to decommis sioning funding should be maintained for the purpose of managing and adjusting fishing capacity. 45 Member States should record the minimum information on characteristics and activities of Union fishing vessels flying their flag. Those records should be made available to the Commission for the purpose of monitoring the size of Member States fleets. 46 Fisheries management based on the best available scientific advice requires harmonised, reliable and accurate data sets. Therefore, Member States should collect data on fleets and their fishing activities, in particular biological data on catches, including discards and survey information on fish stocks and on the potential environmental impact of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem. Member States should manage and make the collected data available to end users and to other interested parties. Member States should cooperate with each other and with the Commission to coordinate data collection activities. Where relevant, Member States should also cooperate with third countries regarding data collection. Member States should provide the Commission, for its assessment, with an annual report on their data collection activities, which shall be made public. 47 Data collection should include data which facilitate the economic assessment of undertakings active in the fisheries sector, in aquaculture and in the processing of fisheries and aquaculture products and of employment trends in those industries. 48 The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries STECF , as established by Commission Decision 2005 629 EC 1 , may be consulted on matters pertaining to the conservation and management of marine biological resources in order to ensure the required assistance of highly qualified scientific personnel, particularly in the application of biological, economic, environmental, social and technical disciplines. 49 Policy oriented fisheries science should be reinforced by means of nationally adopted fisheries scientific data collection, research and innovation programmes imple mented in coordination with other Member States and within Union research and innovation frameworks. Better cooperation between industry and scientists should also be fostered. 50 The Union should promote the objectives of the CFP internationally, ensuring that Union fishing activities outside Union waters are based on the same principles and standards as those applicable under Union law, and promoting a level playing field for Union operators and third country operators. To this end, the Union should seek to lead the process of strengthening the performance of regional and international organisations in order to better enable them to conserve and manage marine living resources under their purview, including combating illegal, unreported and unregulated IUU fishing. The Union should cooperate with third countries and international organisations for the EN L 354 26 Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2013 1 Commission Decision 2005 629 EC of 26 August 2005 establishing a Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries OJ L 225, 31.8.2005, p. 18 .  purpose of improving compliance with international measures, including combating IUU. The position of the Union should be based on the best available scientific advice. 51 Sustainable fisheries partnership agreements with third countries should ensure that Union fishing activities in third country waters are based on the best available scientific advice and relevant information exchange, ensuring a sustainable exploitation of the marine biological resources, transparency as regards the deter mination of the surplus and, consequently, a management of the resources that is consistent with the objectives of the CFP. Those agreements, which provide for access to resources commensurate with the interests of the Union fleet in exchange for a financial contribution from the Union, should contribute to the establishment of a high quality governance framework to ensure, in particular, efficient data collection, monitoring, control and surveillance measures. 52 Respect for democratic principles and human rights, as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international human rights instru ments, and for the principle of the rule of law, should constitute an essential element of sustainable fisheries partnership agreements, which should contain a specific human rights clause. The introduction of a human rights clause in sustainable fisheries partnership agreements should be fully consistent with the overall Union devel opment policy objectives. 53 Aquaculture should contribute to the preservation of the food production potential on a sustainable basis throughout the Union so as to guarantee long term food security, including food supplies, as well as growth and employment for Union citizens, and to contribute to meeting the growing world demand for aquatic food. 54 The Commission s Strategy for the Sustainable Devel opment of European Aquaculture adopted in 2009, which was welcomed and endorsed by the Council and welcomed by the European Parliament, noted the need for the creation and promotion of a level playing field for aquaculture as the basis for its sustainable development. 55 Aquaculture activities in the Union are influenced by different conditions across national borders, including as regards authorisations for the operators. Therefore, Union strategic guidelines for national strategic plans should be developed to improve the competitiveness of the aquaculture industry, supporting its development and innovation, and encouraging economic activity, diversifi cation and improving the quality of life in coastal and inland areas. Furthermore, mechanisms should be introduced for the exchange between Member States of information and best practices through an open method of coordination of national measures concerning business security, access to Union waters and space, and the simplification of licensing procedures. 56 The specific nature of aquaculture requires an Advisory Council for stakeholder consultation on elements of Union policies which could affect aquaculture. 57 There is a need to strengthen the competitiveness of the Union fishery and aquaculture sector, and for simplifi cation in support of better management of its production and marketing activities. The common market organi sation for fishery and aquaculture products should ensure a level playing field for all fishery and aquaculture products marketed in the Union regardless of their origin, should enable consumers to make better informed choices and support responsible consumption, and should improve the economic knowledge and under standing of the Union markets along the supply chain. 58 The common market organisation should be imple mented in compliance with international commitments of the Union, in particular with regard to the provisions of the World Trade Organisation. 59 In order to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP, an effective system of control, inspection and enforcement should be established, that includes the fight against IUU fishing activities. 60 The use of modern and effective technologies should be promoted in the framework of the Union system for control, inspection, and enforcement. Member States and the Commission should have the possibility to conduct pilot projects on new control technologies and data management systems. 61 In order to ensure that the conditions in different Member States for the application of control and enforcement rules are comparable, cooperation between Member States on identifying effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties should be encouraged. 62 In order to ensure the involvement of operators in the Union data collection and in the Union system for control, inspection, and enforcement, Member States should be able to require their operators to contribute proportionally to the corresponding operational costs. EN 28.12.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 354 27   63 The objectives of the CFP cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone, given the problems encountered in the development of the fishing industry and its management, and the limits on the financial resources of the Member States. Therefore, to contribute to the achievement of those objectives, multiannual Union financial assistance should be granted that is focused on the priorities of the CFP and tailored to the specific features of the fishing industry in individual Member States. 64 Union financial assistance should be made conditional upon compliance by Member States and operators, including vessel owners, with the rules of the CFP. Subject to specific rules to be adopted, Union financial assistance should be interrupted, suspended or corrected in cases of non compliance with a specific obligation of the CFP by a Member State or a serious infringement of those rules by an operator. 65 Dialogue with stakeholders has proven to be essential for achieving the objectives of the CFP. Taking into account the diverse conditions throughout Union waters and the increased regionalisation of the CFP, Advisory Councils should enable the CFP to benefit from the knowledge and experience of all stakeholders. 66 In view of the special characteristics of the outermost regions, of aquaculture, of markets and of the Black Sea, it is appropriate to establish a new Advisory Council for each of them. 67 The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of conservation measures accom panying certain environmental obligations by Member States, the adapting of the landing obligation for the purpose of complying with the Union s international obligations, the extension of the landing obligation to other species using the regionalisation process, the adoption of specific discard plans using the regional isation process, the adoption of de minimis exemptions to the landing obligation if no other implementation measure for that obligation has been adopted, and the establishment of detailed rules for the functioning of Advisory Councils. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. 68 In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implemen tation of the provisions of this Regulation in respect of temporary measures to alleviate a serious threat to the conservation of marine biological resources, of the entry exit scheme in fleet management and of the recording, format and transmission of data for the Union fishing fleet register, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation EU No 182 2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 . 69 In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives. 70 Council Decision 2004 585 EC 2 should be repealed upon entry in force of the corresponding rules pursuant to this Regulation. 71 By reason of the number and importance of the amendments to be made, Regulation EC No 2371 2002 should be repealed, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION PART I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Scope 1.

Article 8 Establishment of fish stock recovery areas 1. The Union shall, while taking due account of existing conservation areas, endeavour to establish protected areas due to their biological sensitivity, including areas where there is clear evidence of heavy concentrations of fish below minimum conservation reference size and of spawning grounds. In such areas fishing activities may be restricted or prohibited in order to contribute to the conservation of living aquatic resources and marine ecosystems. The Union shall continue to give additional protection to existing biologically sensitive areas. 2. For those purposes, Member States shall identify, where possible, suitable areas which may form part of a coherent network and shall prepare, where appropriate, joint recommen dations in accordance with Article 18 7 with a view to the Commission submitting a proposal in accordance with the Treaty. 3. The Commission may be empowered in a multiannual plan to establish such biologically sensitive protected areas. Article 18 1 to 6 shall apply. The Commission shall report regularly to the European Parliament and to the Council on protected areas. TITLE II Specific measures Article 9 Principles and objectives of multiannual plans 1. Multiannual plans shall be adopted as a priority, based on scientific, technical and economic advice, and shall contain conservation measures to restore and maintain fish stocks above levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield in accordance with Article 2 2 . 2. Where targets relating to the maximum sustainable yield as referred to in Article 2 2 cannot be determined, owing to insufficient data, the multiannual plans shall provide for measures based on the precautionary approach, ensuring at least a comparable degree of conservation of the relevant stocks. 3. Multiannual plans shall cover either a single species or b in the case of mixed fisheries or where the dynamics of stocks relate to one another, fisheries exploiting several stocks in a relevant geographical area, taking into account knowledge about the interactions between fish stocks, fisheries and marine ecosystems. EN 28.12.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 354 33  4. The measures to be included in multiannual plans, and the calendar for implementing them, shall be proportionate to the objectives and targets pursued and to the time frame envisaged. Before measures are included in the multiannual plans, account shall be taken of their likely economic and social impact. 5. Multiannual plans may contain specific conservation objectives and measures based on the ecosystem approach in order to address the specific problems of mixed fisheries in relation to the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 2 2 for the mixture of stocks covered by the plan in cases where scientific advice indicates that increases in selectivity cannot be achieved. Where necessary, the multiannual plan shall include specific alternative conservation measures, based on the ecosystem approach, for some of the stocks that it covers. Article 10 Content of multiannual plans 1. As appropriate and without prejudice to the respective competences under the Treaty, a multiannual plan shall include a the scope, in terms of stocks, fishery and the area to which the multiannual plan shall be applied b objectives that are consistent with the objectives set out in Article 2 and with the relevant provisions of Articles 6 and 9 c quantifiable targets such as fishing mortality rates and or spawning stock biomass d clear time frames to reach the quantifiable targets e conservation reference points consistent with the objectives set out in Article 2 f objectives for conservation and technical measures to be taken in order to achieve the targets set out in Article 15, and measures designed to avoid and reduce, as far as possible, unwanted catches g safeguards to ensure that quantifiable targets are met, as well as remedial action, where needed, including for situ ations where the deteriorating quality of data or non avail ability put the sustainability of the stock at risk. 2. A multiannual plan may also include a other conservation measures, in particular measures to gradually eliminate discards, taking into account the best available scientific advice, or to minimise the negative impact of fishing on the ecosystem, to be further specified, where appropriate, in accordance with Article 18 b quantifiable indicators for periodic monitoring and assessment of progress in achieving the targets of the multi annual plan c where appropriate, specific objectives for the freshwater part of the life cycle of anadromous and catadromous species. 3. A multiannual plan shall provide for its revision after an initial ex post evaluation, in particular to take account of changes in scientific advice. Article 11 Conservation measures necessary for compliance with obligations under Union environmental legislation 1. Member States are empowered to adopt conservation measures not affecting fishing vessels of other Member States that are applicable to waters under their sovereignty or juris diction and that are necessary for the purpose of complying with their obligations under Article 13 4 of Directive 2008 56 EC, Article 4 of Directive 2009 147 EC or Article 6 of Directive 92 43 EEC, provided that those measures are compatible with the objectives set out in Article 2 of this Regulation, meet the objectives of the relevant Union legislation that they intend to implement, and are at least as stringent as measures under Union law. 2. Where a Member State the initiating Member State considers that measures need to be adopted for the purpose of complying with the obligations referred to in paragraph 1 and other Member States have a direct management interest in the fishery to be affected by such measures, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt such measures, upon request, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 46. For this purpose, Article 18 1 to 4 and 6 shall apply mutatis mutandis. 3. The initiating Member State shall provide the Commission and the other Member States having a direct management interest with relevant information on the measures required, including their rationale, scientific evidence in support and details on their practical implementation and enforcement. The initiating Member State and the other Member States having a direct management interest may submit a joint recom mendation, as referred to in Article 18 1 , within six months from the provision of sufficient information. The Commission shall adopt the measures, taking into account any available scientific advice, within three months from receipt of a complete request. If not all Member States succeed in agreeing on a joint recom mendation to be submitted to the Commission in accordance with the first subparagraph within the deadline set therein, or if the joint recommendation is deemed not to be compatible with the requirements referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission may submit a proposal in accordance with the Treaty. EN L 354 34 Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2013  4. By way of derogation from paragraph 3, in the absence of a joint recommendation referred to in paragraph 3, in cases of urgency, the Commission shall adopt the measures. The measures to be adopted in a case of urgency shall be limited to those in the absence of which the achievement of the objectives associated with the establishment of the conservation measures in accordance with the Directives referred to in paragraph 1 and the Member State s intentions, is in jeopardy. 5. The measures referred to in paragraph 4 shall apply for a maximum period of 12 months which may be extended for a maximum period of 12 months where the conditions provided for in that paragraph continue to exist. 6. The Commission shall facilitate cooperation between the Member State concerned and the other Member States having a direct management interest in the fishery in the process of implementation and enforcement of the measures adopted under paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. Article 12 Commission measures in case of a serious threat to marine biological resources 1. On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to a serious threat to the conservation of marine biological resources or to the marine ecosystem based on evidence, the Commission, at the reasoned request of a Member State or on its own initiative, may, in order to alleviate that threat, adopt immediately applicable implementing acts applicable for a maximum period of six months in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 47 3 . 2. The Member State shall communicate the request referred to in paragraph 1 simultaneously to the Commission, to other Member States and to the Advisory Councils concerned. The other Member States and the Advisory Councils may submit their written comments within seven working days of the receipt of the notification. The Commission shall take a decision within 15 working days of the receipt of the request referred to in paragraph 1. 3. Before expiry of the initial period of application of immediately applicable implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission may, where the conditions under paragraph 1 are complied with, adopt immediately applicable implementing acts extending the application of such emergency measure for a maximum period of six months with immediate effect. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 47 3 . Article 13 Member State emergency measures 1. On the basis of evidence of a serious threat to the conser vation of marine biological resources or to the marine ecosystem relating to fishing activities in waters falling under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a Member State that require immediate action, that Member State may adopt emergency measures to alleviate the threat. Such measures shall be compatible with the objectives set out in Article 2 and no less stringent than those provided for in Union law. Such measures shall apply for a maximum period of three months. 2. Where emergency measures to be adopted by a Member State are liable to affect fishing vessels of other Member States, such measures shall be adopted only after consulting the Commission, the relevant Member States and the relevant Advisory Councils on a draft of the measures accompanied by an explanatory memorandum. The consulting Member State may set a reasonable deadline for the consultation which shall, however, not be shorter than one month. 3. Where the Commission considers that a measure adopted under this Article does not comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 1, it may, subject to providing relevant reasons, request that the Member State concerned amend or repeal that measure. Article 14 Avoidance and minimisation of unwanted catches 1. In order to facilitate the introduction of the obligation to land all catches in the respective fishery in accordance with Article 15 the landing obligation , Member States may conduct pilot projects, based on the best available scientific advice and taking into account the opinions of the relevant Advisory Councils, with the aim of fully exploring all prac ticable methods for the avoidance, minimisation and elim ination of unwanted catches in a fishery. 2. Member States may produce a discard atlas showing the level of discards in each of the fisheries which are covered by Article 15 1 . Article 15 Landing obligation 1. All catches of species which are subject to catch limits and, in the Mediterranean, also catches of species which are subject to minimum sizes as defined in Annex III to Regulation EC No 1967 2006, caught during fishing activities in Union waters or by Union fishing vessels outside Union waters in waters not subject to third countries sovereignty or jurisdiction, in the fisheries and geographical areas listed below shall be brought and retained on board the fishing vessels, recorded, landed and counted against the quotas where applicable, except when used as live bait, in accordance with the following time frames a From 1 January 2015 at the latest small pelagic fisheries i.e. fisheries for mackerel, herring, horse mackerel, blue whiting, boarfish, anchovy, argentine, sardine, sprat large pelagic fisheries i.e. fisheries for bluefin tuna, swordfish, albacore tuna, bigeye tuna, blue and white marlin EN 28.12.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 354 35   fisheries for industrial purposes inter alia, fisheries for capelin, sandeel and Norwegian pout fisheries for salmon in the Baltic Sea. b From 1 January 2015 at the latest for species which define the fisheries and from 1 January 2017 at the latest for all other species in fisheries in Union waters of the Baltic Sea for species subject to catch limits other than those covered by point a . c From 1 January 2016 at the latest for the species which define the fisheries and from 1 January 2019 at the latest for all other species in i the North Sea fisheries for cod, haddock, whiting, saithe fisheries for Norway lobster fisheries for common sole and plaice fisheries for hake fisheries for Northern prawn ii North Western waters fisheries for cod, haddock, whiting, saithe fisheries for Norway lobster fisheries for common sole and plaice fisheries for hake iii South Western waters fisheries for Norway lobster fisheries for common sole and plaice fisheries for hake iv other fisheries for species subject to catch limits. d From 1 January 2017 at the latest for species which define the fisheries and from 1 January 2019 at the latest for all other species in fisheries not covered by point a in the Mediterranean, in the Black Sea and in all other Union waters and in non Union waters not subject to third coun tries sovereignty or jurisdiction. 2. Paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to the Union s international obligations. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 46, for the purpose of implementing such international obligations into Union law, including, in particular, derogations from the landing obligation under this Article. 3. Where all the Member States having a direct management interest in a particular fishery agree that the landing obligation should apply to species other than those listed in paragraph 1, they may submit a joint recommendation for the purpose of extending the application of the landing obligation to such other species. For this purpose, Article 18 1 to 6 shall apply mutatis mutandis. Where such a joint recommendation is submitted, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 46, containing such measures. 4. The landing obligation referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply to a species in respect of which fishing is prohibited and which are identified as such in a Union legal act adopted in the area of the CFP b species for which scientific evidence demonstrates high survival rates, taking into account the characteristics of the gear, of the fishing practices and of the ecosystem c catches falling under de minimis exemptions. 5. Details of the implementation of the landing obligation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be specified in multiannual plans referred to in Articles 9 and 10 and, where relevant, further specified in accordance with Article 18, including a specific provisions regarding fisheries or species covered by the landing obligation referred to in paragraph 1 b the specification of exemptions to the landing obligation of species referred to in point b of paragraph 4 c provisions for de minimis exemptions of up to 5 of total annual catches of all species subject to the landing obligation referred to in paragraph 1. The de minimis exemption shall apply in the following cases i where scientific evidence indicates that increases in selectivity are very difficult to achieve or ii to avoid disproportionate costs of handling unwanted catches, for those fishing gears where unwanted catches per fishing gear do not represent more than a certain percentage, to be established in a plan, of total annual catch of that gear. EN L 354 36 Official Journal of the European Union 28.12.2013  Catches under the provisions referred to in this point shall not be counted against the relevant quotas however, all such catches shall be fully recorded. For a transitional period of four years, the percentage of the total annual catches referred to in this point shall increase i by two percentage points in the first two years of appli cation of the landing obligation and ii by one percentage point in the subsequent two years d provisions on documentation of catches e where appropriate, the fixing of minimum conservation reference sizes in accordance with paragraph 10. 6. Where no multiannual plan, or no management plan in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation EC No 1967 2006, is adopted for the fishery in question, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt, in accordance with Article 18 of this Regulation, delegated acts in accordance with Article 46 of this Regulation, laying down on a temporary basis and for a period of no more than three years a specific discard plan containing the specifications referred to in points a to e of paragraph 5 of this Article. Member States may cooperate, in accordance with Article 18 of this Regulation, in the drawing up of such a plan with a view to the Commission adopting such acts or submitting a proposal in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. 7. Where no measures have been adopted for the purpose of specifying the de minimis exemption either in a multiannual plan in accordance with paragraph 5 or in a specific discard plan in accordance with paragraph 6, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 46, setting the de minimis exemption referred to in point c of paragraph 4 which shall, subject to the conditions set out in point c i or ii of paragraph 5, amount to no more than 5 of total annual catches of all species to which the landing obligation applies under paragraph 1. That de minimis exemption shall be adopted so as to apply from the date of application of the relevant landing obligation. 8. By way of derogation from the obligation to count catches against the relevant quotas in accordance with paragraph 1, catches of species that are subject to the landing obligation and that are caught in excess of quotas of the stocks in question, or catches of species in respect of which the Member State has no quota, may be deducted from the quota of the target species provided that they do not exceed 9 of the quota of the target species. This provision shall only apply where the stock of the non target species is within safe biological limits. 9. For stocks subject to the landing obligation, Member States may use a year to year flexibility of up to 10 of their permitted landings. For this purpose, a Member State may allow landing of additional quantities of the stock that is subject to the landing obligation provided that such quantities do not exceed 10 of the quota allocated to that Member State. Article 105 of Regulation EC No 1224 2009 shall apply. 10. Minimum conservation reference sizes may be estab lished with the aim of ensuring the protection of juveniles of marine organisms. 11. For the species subject to the landing obligation as specified in paragraph 1, the use of catches of species below the minimum conservation reference size shall be restricted to purposes other than direct human consumption, including fish meal, fish oil, pet food, food additives, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. 12. For species that are not subject to the landing obligation as specified in paragraph 1, the catches of species below the minimum conservation reference size shall not be retained on board, but shall be returned immediately to the sea. 13. For the purpose of monitoring compliance with the landing obligation, Member States shall ensure detailed and accurate documentation of all fishing trips and adequate capacity and means, such as observers, closed circuit television CCTV and others. In doing so, Member States shall respect the principle of efficiency and proportionality. Article 16 Fishing opportunities 1. Fishing opportunities allocated to Member States shall ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each fish stock or fishery. The interests of each Member State shall be taken into account when new fishing opportunities are allocated. 2. When the landing obligation in respect of a fish stock is introduced, fishing opportunities shall be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches, on the basis of the fact that, for the first and subsequent years, discarding of that stock will no longer be allowed. 3. Where new scientific evidence shows that there is a significant disparity between the fishing opportunities that have been fixed for a specific stock and the actual state of that stock, Member States having a direct management interest may submit a reasoned request to the Commission for it to submit a proposal to alleviate that disparity, while respecting the objectives set out in Article 2 2 . 4. Fishing opportunities shall be fixed in accordance with the objectives set out in Article 2 2 and shall comply with quan tifiable targets, time frames and margins established in accordance with Article 9 2 and points b and c of Article 10 1 . EN 28.12.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 354 37  5. Measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing oppor tunities available to third countries in Union waters shall be established in accordance with the Treaty. 6. Each Member State shall decide how the fishing oppor tunities that are allocated to it, and which are not subject to a system of transferable fishing concessions, may be allocated to vessels flying its flag e.g. by creating individual fishing oppor tunities . It shall inform the Commission of the allocation method. 7. For the allocation of fishing opportunities pertaining to mixed fisheries, Member States shall take account of the likely catch composition of vessels participating in such fisheries. 8. Member States may, after notifying the Commission, exchange all or part of the fishing opportunities allocated to them. Article 17 Criteria for the allocation of fishing opportunities by Member States When allocating the fishing opportunities available to them, as referred to in Article 16, Member States shall use transparent and objective criteria including those of an environmental, social and economic nature. The criteria to be used may include, inter alia, the impact of fishing on the environment, the history of compliance, the contribution to the local economy and historic catch levels. Within the fishing oppor tunities allocated to them, Member States shall endeavour to provide incentives to fishing vessels deploying selective fishing gear or using fishing techniques with reduced environmental impact, such as reduced energy consumption or habitat damage. TITLE III Regionalisation Article 18 Regional cooperation on conservation measures 1.
