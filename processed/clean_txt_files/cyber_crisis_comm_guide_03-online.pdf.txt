A strong communication and reputation management plan can effectively mitigate their impact.   Size and complexity of the organisation, influence the cyber crisis communication plan and need to address necessary communication aspects.   Additional planning, coordination, or training might be needed to ensure effective communication during a crisis.   Learn from the experiences of other organisations that have faced similar incidents. By considering these factors and conducting a thorough assessment, one can determine whether a cyber crisis communication plan is necessary for the organisation and the level of detail required to address the specific risks and stakeholders. Remember to regularly review and update this plan as the cybersecurity landscape evolves and the organisation s needs change. When a disaster strikes, it is essential that an organisation be able to communicate internally and also with the outside world   if an organisation is unable to keep the outside world informed of its recovery status, the public is likely to fear the worst and assume that the organisation is unable to recover   it is also necessary that the organisation communicates about disaster internally so that employees know what steps they are expected to take in that situation 3 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  PREPARING THE COMMUNICATION PLAN 2.1 IDENTIFYING OBJECTIVES The first step in this process is to set the objectives of the cyber crisis communications plan. These derive from the overall organisation goals, in terms of awareness raising and education. Those will, in turn, determine the selection of the specific tools and methods to be used. Every organisation might set different objectives for its own cyber crisis communications plan, yet some generic ones that are always applicable are the following 2.1.1 Protect the organisation s reputation A cyber crisis can damage an organisation s reputation, causing long term harm to the business. The first objective of a cyber crisis communications plan should be to protect the organisation s reputation by communicating quickly, transparently, and effectively with stakeholders. This objective involves carefully crafting key messages, controlling media interactions, and addressing stakeholder concerns in a way that mitigates negative perceptions and preserves the organisation s reputation. 2.1.2 Provide timely and accurate information The crisis communication plan aims to ensure that accurate and up to date information regarding the cyber incident is communicated to stakeholders in a timely manner. This objective helps minimise rumours, misinformation, and confusion, and establishes the organisation as a reliable source of information. 2 4  2.1.3 Ensure customers or stakeholders are informed In the event of a cyber crisis, it is critical that all stakeholders are kept informed of the situation. This includes employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and regulatory authorities. The crisis communication plan should outline how and when each stakeholder group will be notified of the incident, and what information will be shared. It should also aim to instil confidence in stakeholders by demonstrating transparency, empathy, and a proactive approach to resolving the cyber incident. Maintaining trust is essential for preserving the organisation s reputation and relationships with stakeholders. 2.1.4 Mitigate the impact of the crisis A cyber crisis can have significant financial and operational impacts on an organisation. The crisis communication plan should include strategies for mitigating these impacts, such as developing contingency plans, prioritising business critical functions, and communicating with other, potentially affected parties. 2.1.5 Manage media relations The crisis communication plan should outline strategies for managing media relations during a cyber crisis. This objective involves providing accurate and timely information to the media, coordinating media interactions, and proactively managing the organisation s public image through effective media engagement. 2.1.6 Coordinate crisis response efforts In order to effectively respond to a cyber crisis, it is important that all internal and external stakeholders are coordinated and working together. The crisis communication plan should outline how different departments within the organisation will collaborate, and how external partners and vendors will be involved in the response effort. 5 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  2.1.7 Learn from the crisis Finally, a cyber crisis can be an opportunity for an o to learn and improve its cyber resilience. The crisis communication plan should include strategies for gathering feedback and data after the crisis has been resolved, in order to identify areas for improvement and make changes to prevent future incidents. Among others it should outline processes for gathering feedback, conducting post incident assessments, and using the insights gained to refine the communication strategies and enhance future crisis response capabilities. 2.2 CHOOSING TARGET GROUP The targeted audience for a cyber crisis communications plan for any organisation includes all stakeholders who may be affected by a cyber incident, such as employees, customers, partners, suppliers, regulatory authorities, and the media. The choice of which stakeholders to include in the plan will depend on the nature of the business operations, the types of sensitive data the organisation handles, and the regulatory requirements for the industry in which it operates. When choosing the audience for a cyber crisis communications plan, it is important to consider each group s specific needs and concerns. For example, employees may require detailed information about how the incident occurred and what steps are being taken to mitigate it, while customers may be more concerned about the safety of their personal information and what steps they can take to protect themselves. Regulatory authorities will likely be interested in showing compliance with relevant data protection regulations, while the media may focus on the impact of the incident on the broader community. It is also important to consider the best channels for communicating with each stakeholder group. For example, employees may be best reached through internal messaging systems, while customers may prefer to receive updates via email or social media. In some cases, it may be necessary to provide targeted messaging for specific stakeholder groups, such as language specific communications for non native speaking customers or simplified messaging for those with limited technical knowledge. 6  Table 1. Employee Internal target groups and channels Audience groups Channels Generic Employees Communicating with employees is essential during a cyber crisis. They need to be well informed about the incident, its impact on the organisation, and any measures being taken to address it. Recommended channels to reach employees include internal email communications, company wide meetings or town halls, intranet portals, and employee communication platforms or apps. Executives and Management Keeping executives and management informed is vital for effective decision making and coordination during a cyber crisis. Regular updates and briefings should be provided to this group. Channels to reach executives and management can include targeted email communications, leadership meetings or conference calls, dedicated executive communication channels, and secure messaging platforms. IT and Security Teams These teams play a critical role in incident response and remediation efforts. Close coordination and communication with IT and security teams are necessary to address the technical aspects of the cyber crisis. Channels such as dedicated incident response platforms, secure collaboration tools, and direct communication channels should be utilised to reach these teams. Internal Stakeholders Depending on the organisation, there may be specific internal stakeholders, such as department heads, project managers, or other key personnel, who need to be included in the communication plan. These stakeholders may have unique responsibilities or requirements during a cyber crisis. Tailored communication channels, including targeted email communications, team meetings, or designated communication liaisons, should be utilised to reach them effectively. By carefully considering the needs of each stakeholder group and choosing the most effective channels for communication, organisations can ensure that their cyber crisis communications plan is tailored to the needs of their audience and is most likely to be effective in mitigating the impacts of a cyber incident. Same applies for external target groups these refer to the individuals, organisations, or entities outside the organisation who may be impacted by or have an interest in the cyber incident. These groups are key stakeholders who need to be informed, engaged, and provided with relevant information during a cyber crisis 7 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  Table 2. External stakeholder target group Audience groups Channels Customers The organisation s customer base is a crucial external target group. They may be directly affected by the cyber incident, such as through data breaches or service disruptions. Customers rely on timely and accurate communication to understand the impact on their personal information, accounts, or services, and to receive guidance on any necessary actions. Recommended channels to reach to stakeholders is through a direct communication line via email or SMS, few hours after the incident have been identified. In some cases, the IT can contact them directly to provide advice or mitigation measures. Partners and Suppliers External organisations that the business collaborates with or rely on for business operations, such as suppliers, vendors, or business partners, should be considered as an external target group. Informing them about the cyber incident is essential for managing potential disruptions to supply chains, shared systems, or data exchange. Channels to reach partners and suppliers can include targeted email communications, designated communication liaisons and in some cases direct communication channels between IT and Security Teams point of contact PoC . Regulatory Authorities Depending on the industry the organisation is operating, various regulatory authorities, such as data protection agencies or industry specific cybersecurity bodies, may require notification and cooperation in the event of a cyber incident. Compliance with legal and regulatory obligations is vital, and these authorities need to be informed in a timely manner. This time is set by the competent authority and usually is between 24 and 72 hours. Channels to reach regulatory authorities are set by national legislation and might be through a dedicated platform, or via email or direct phone call. The organisation must be informed and hold this information in the incident response policy. Media The media plays a significant role in shaping public perception and disseminating information during a crisis. Journalists, reporters, and media outlets are external target groups that need to be provided with accurate and consistent information. Proactive engagement with the media can help manage the narrative surrounding the cyber incident. Designated communication liaisons or communication lead should reach targeted channels or media with tailor made statements and messages. 8  Audience groups Channels Investors and Shareholders Organisations with publicly traded stocks or investors have a responsibility to keep their stakeholders informed about the potential impact of a cyber incident on the company s operations, financials, and reputation. Shareholders, institutional investors, and analysts may need to be updated on the incident s ramifications and the steps being taken to address it. Tailored communication channels, including targeted email communications, shareholders meetings, or designated communication liaisons, should be utilised to reach them effectively. General public Depending on the nature and scope of the cyber incident, the local community or the general public may be indirectly affected or have an interest in understanding the implications. Providing accurate and transparent communication can help mitigate any concerns or potential reputational damage. Communication via the mass media can have great outreach to the local community and general public. Tailor made messages to ensure mitigation measures are important. 2.3 SITUATION ASSESSMENT When faced with a cyber crisis, it is crucial to begin by defining the nature and extent of the incident. This involves gathering comprehensive information about the root cause, scope, and severity of the cyber event. This exercise is performed by the designated incident response team, but final result should take into account communication related aspects such as   Affecting safety and wellbeing of people   Affecting the reputation of the organisation   Possible political implications   Affecting the establishment of the organisation   Legal implications or lack of compliance with current regulation   Affecting the confidence of the organisation towards stakeholders 9 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  The assessment process may require the involvement of cybersecurity experts, forensic analysts, legal counsel, and other relevant professionals, depending on the scale and complexity of the incident. The Governing board or C level executives would also need to provide their view and eventually approve the communications plan built on this information. Collaboration and coordination among experts can enhance the accuracy and depth of the assessment, enabling a more informed response to the cyber incident. Severity levels can be high, medium or low, and below some communication techniques based on each level. High Severity 1. Immediate Notification In the event of a high severity cyber incident, the crisis communication plan should prioritise immediate notification of key stakeholders, including executive leadership, IT security teams, legal, and relevant departments. Communication channels should be established in advance for rapid dissemination of information. 2. Impact Assessment Quickly assess the potential impact on the organisation s critical systems, data, and operations. Determine the extent of data breaches, system compromises, and potential financial or reputational damage. 3. Escalation and Decision Making Establish a clear chain of command for decision making and escalation. Key executives should be informed and involved in determining the course of action, which may include activating the incident response team, engaging external experts, and coordinating with law enforcement if necessary. 4. External Communication Coordinate with legal and public relations teams to develop external communication strategies. While the initial focus is on containing the incident, prepare for potential regulatory reporting, customer notifications, and media engagement if the incident escalates. 5. Internal Communication Communicate clearly and concisely with employees about the incident s severity, potential impact on their work, and any immediate actions they need to take. Provide guidance on how to avoid spreading misinformation and emphasise the importance of reporting any suspicious activity. 10  Medium Severity 1. Stakeholder Notification Notify relevant stakeholders, including IT security teams, department heads, and legal, about the incident. Share initial information about the incident s potential impact and ongoing assessment. 2. Impact Assessment Conduct a thorough impact assessment to understand the extent of the incident and potential risks. Determine if critical systems are affected and whether data breaches have occurred. 3. Incident Response Activation Activate the incident response team and begin containment and remediation efforts. Communicate internally with the team about their roles and responsibilities during the incident response. 4. External Communication Prepare to provide updates to external parties as the situation evolves. Develop messaging that acknowledges the incident, reassures customers and partners, and conveys that the organisation is taking appropriate action. 5. Internal Communication Inform employees about the incident s potential impact on their work and any precautionary measures they should take. Provide regular updates to keep them informed about the organisation s response efforts. Low Severity 1. Internal Notification Notify relevant internal teams, particularly IT security staff, about the incident. Begin gathering information to assess the incident s scope and impact. 2. Impact Assessment Assess the incident s impact on non critical systems and data. Determine whether any sensitive information has been compromised. 3. Remediation Initiate appropriate remediation measures to contain and mitigate the incident. Update internal teams on the progress of containment efforts. 4. Limited External Communication If necessary, prepare to provide limited updates to external parties, focusing on transparency and reassurance. Avoid unnecessary alarm while keeping stakeholders informed. 11 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  5. Internal Communication Communicate to employees about the incident s low severity, the actions being taken, and any precautions they should be aware of. Emphasise the organisation s commitment to cybersecurity. By tailoring your crisis communication plan to these severity levels and focusing on potential impacts, your organisation can effectively respond to cyber incidents while maintaining transparency, minimising disruption, and safeguarding its reputation. 2.4 CREATING A CRISIS COMMUNICATIONS TEAM Creating a cyber crisis communications team is an essential component of any cyber crisis communications plan for SMEs. The team should consist of individuals with specific roles and responsibilities for managing communications both internally and externally. When creating the Team, it is advised to include representatives from relevant departments, such as IT, legal, public relations, and executive management. Below are some of the key roles and functions that should be considered for the team. The Incident Manager is ultimately responsible for all communications related decisions during a crisis. The incident manager is responsible for coordinating the overall response effort and ensuring that all members of the team are working together effectively. This individual should have strong leadership skills and be able to make decisions quickly in a high pressure environment. The incident manager acts as the head of the Crisis Communications Team. The Spokesperson or Communications coordinator plays a crucial role as the primary point of contact and official representative of the organisation during a cyber crisis. Their core activities revolve around effective communication, reputation management, and stakeholder engagement. Firstly, the spokesperson is responsible for delivering clear, consistent, and accurate messages that align with the organisation s communication strategy. They serve as the voice of the organisation, conveying key messages to the media, stakeholders, and the public. Their role involves developing and delivering messages that address the concerns and needs of different stakeholder groups, ensuring the information is tailored appropriately. It is importamnt to keep the contact details of some key audiences offline, in case systems become unavailable e.g. local emergency services, security service provider, potentially top clients and suppliers, regulators, differenrt stakeholders 12  Secondly, the spokesperson acts as the main interface for media interactions. They handle interviews, press conferences, and media inquiries, responding to questions, concerns, and providing timely and accurate information. Their ability to engage with journalists professionally, while staying aligned with the organisation s messaging, is critical in shaping public perception and managing the narrative surrounding the cyber incident. Furthermore, the spokesperson plays a pivotal role in reputation management. They convey a sense of empathy, transparency, and accountability, working to maintain stakeholders trust and confidence. By addressing reputational risks proactively and handling external communication with integrity, the spokesperson helps protect the organisation s brand and image throughout the crisis. Lastly, the spokesperson engages with external stakeholders, such as customers, partners, regulatory authorities, and the public. They provide updates, address concerns, and offer guidance to these groups. This engagement is crucial in maintaining open lines of communication, managing expectations, and building trust. The spokesperson ensures timely and accurate information flow, helping stakeholders navigate the crisis and providing reassurance during a challenging time. Technical Expert The technical expert should have deep knowledge of the SME s IT infrastructure and be able to provide guidance on technical issues related to the incident. This individual should also be able to advise on technical solutions for mitigating the incident and preventing future occurrences. Keep in mind that at the beginning of an incident technical experts are busy with the remediation and investigation. Therefore, make sure to gather the relevant questions in advance and occupy the technical expert as shortly as possible in rapid sync up meetings. Externally, the team is responsible for managing communications with customers, partners, suppliers, regulatory authorities, and the media. This may include drafting and disseminating public statements, coordinating with the legal team to ensure compliance with data protection regulations, and managing media relations. The team should also be responsible for monitoring social media channels and responding to inquiries from stakeholders. 13 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  Legal Advisor The legal advisor is responsible for ensuring that all communications related to the incident are compliant with relevant data protection regulations and other legal requirements. This individual should have strong knowledge of data protection law and be able to provide guidance on legal issues related to the incident. Human Resources Representative The human resources representative should be responsible for communicating with employees and ensuring that their needs are met in the aftermath of the incident. This individual should be able to provide guidance on employee communication and support. An example table of possible roles and associated responsibilities are to be found in Annex I. 2.5 DEVELOP KEY MESSAGES When developing key messages during the activation of a cyber crisis communication plan, there are several main points to consider. First and foremost, accuracy and transparency should be prioritised. It is crucial to provide information that is verified, factually correct, and free from speculation. By sharing accurate and transparent messages, the organisation can establish credibility and trust among stakeholders. Clear and concise language is another important aspect of key message development. Messages should be formulated in a manner that is easily understood by diverse stakeholders, avoiding technical jargon or complex terminology. Using simple and straightforward language ensures that the messages can be easily comprehended and remembered, enabling effective communication during a time of crisis. Stakeholder relevance is another key consideration. Different stakeholder groups have specific concerns and interests, and messages should be tailored accordingly. By addressing the unique needs of each group, organisations can provide information that is meaningful and impactful to the recipients. Customising the messages to resonate with the stakeholders enhances their understanding and engagement. Lastly, empathy and assurance should be incorporated into the key messages. Demonstrating empathy towards those affected by the cyber incident and acknowledging their concerns helps establish a compassionate tone. Additionally, providing assurances regarding the organisation s commitment to resolving the issue, protecting affected 14  individuals, and preventing future incidents instils a sense of trust and confidence. Empathy and assurance can help alleviate anxiety and foster a positive perception of the organisation s response to the crisis. In summary, when developing key messages for a cyber crisis, organisations should focus on accuracy, transparency, clear language, stakeholder relevance, empathy, and assurance. By considering these main points, organisations can effectively communicate with stakeholders, build trust, and navigate the crisis with transparency and confidence. 2.6 ESTABLISH INTERNAL COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS To facilitate effective internal communication during a cyber crisis, it is crucial to develop clear and well defined procedures. These procedures should outline the steps and protocols for sharing information within the organisation, ensuring that messaging remains consistent and accurate across all departments and teams. By establishing a structured framework for internal communication, organisations can minimise confusion, prevent the spread of misinformation, and maintain a unified approach in addressing the crisis. In addition to defining procedures, it is essential to clearly assign roles and responsibilities for communication during a crisis. Designate specific individuals or teams who will be responsible for managing and disseminating information within the organisation. Each role should have well defined responsibilities and understand their authority when it comes to sharing information. Furthermore, it is important to provide guidelines regarding the types of information that can be shared internally and externally, as well as establish approval processes for sensitive or strategic messages. By implementing clear guidelines and approval mechanisms, organisations can ensure that only appropriate and authorised information is communicated, minimising the risk of unintended consequences or misrepresentation during a cyber crisis. It is also crucial to inform all employees about the main points of the crisis communication plan, let them familiar with the plan, the roles and goals. Employees must also be informed about their roles and responsibilities with regard cyber crisis communication e.g. how to use their social media, what information they can and what information they can t share about the unfolding situation. 15 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  2.7 EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION During a cyber crisis, proactive communication with external stakeholders is crucial in managing the situation effectively. It is essential to provide timely updates to keep stakeholders informed about the incident, its impact, and the steps being taken to address it. This includes addressing their concerns and managing their expectations regarding the resolution and recovery process. It is important to prioritise communication with various external stakeholders, such as affected individuals, regulatory authorities, customers, partners, and the media. Each stakeholder group may have unique concerns and information needs, and tailoring the communication approach accordingly helps maintain trust, transparency, and open lines of communication. In the age of social media and online platforms, monitoring discussions and sentiment related to the cyber incident is vital. Organisations should actively track social media channels, forums, and other relevant online platforms to identify emerging issues, rumours, or misinformation circulating about the incident. By promptly addressing any inaccuracies, clarifying information, and responding to concerns raised by the online community, organisations can help mitigate the potential negative impact and maintain a positive reputation. Monitoring social media also provides an opportunity to gauge public sentiment and adapt communication strategies as necessary to address emerging trends or issues. Being attentive and responsive in online spaces can contribute to effective stakeholder engagement and help shape the narrative surrounding the cyber crisis. 2.8 MEDIA RELATIONS To effectively manage media interactions during a cyber crisis, it is crucial to prepare designated spokespersons who will represent the organisation. These spokespersons should undergo comprehensive media training to ensure they are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to handle interviews, press conferences, and other media engagements. Media training helps spokespersons deliver consistent, accurate, and professional messages while effectively managing the dynamics of media interactions. By honing their communication skills and becoming familiar with techniques for conveying key messages and responding to challenging questions, spokespersons can effectively represent the organisation and uphold its reputation during media engagements. At the beginning and during the incidents there might not be 100 certainty of the technical factors. Keep your messages as simple as possible. 16  In addition to media training, organisations should develop press materials to support media interactions. These materials serve as valuable resources for spokespersons and journalists, providing them with accurate and relevant information about the cyber incident. Press materials may include press releases, which succinctly summarise the incident, its impact, and the organisation s response efforts. Q A documents can anticipate common questions from the media and provide well crafted answers to ensure consistent messaging. Fact sheets can offer additional background information, statistics, or technical details about the incident. Developing these press materials in advance helps streamline communication, ensures accuracy and consistency, and enables spokespersons to provide timely and reliable information to the media during a cyber crisis. 2.9 MONITORING AND EVALUATION To ensure ongoing improvement and effectiveness of the cyber crisis communication efforts, it is crucial to establish a system for continuous monitoring and evaluation. This involves analysing feedback from stakeholders, monitoring sentiment in the media and online platforms, and assessing media coverage. By actively monitoring these factors, organisations can gauge the impact of their communication efforts, identify any gaps or areas for improvement, and make necessary adjustments in real time. This ongoing evaluation allows for agile decision making and the ability to adapt communication strategies as the cyber crisis unfolds. In addition to continuous monitoring, conducting post incident reviews is essential for capturing lessons learned and refining the cyber crisis communication plan. These reviews involve a thorough assessment of the organisation s response to the cyber incident, including the effectiveness of the communication strategies employed. By analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the communication plan, organisations can identify areas that performed well and areas that need improvement. Lessons learned from the incident can be used to update and enhance the crisis communication plan, ensuring that it remains relevant and robust for future incidents. Regular post incident reviews foster a culture of continuous improvement, enabling organisations to continually enhance their crisis communication capabilities and better prepare for future cyber crises. In some countries local governments provide guidance and templates to create documents related to cyber crisis communciation. always consult with your local regulator or competent authorities for further guidances. 17 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  2.10 STRATEGIES A clear and well structured strategy is crucial when developing a cyber crisis communication plan. Consider the following main points when creating such a plan. Organisations may consider expanding their existing communication strategies, if available. 2.10.1 Spokesperson Response When a company makes a mistake, the best course of action is to apologise and demonstrate genuine humanity. Assigning a spokesperson to represent the brand is the most effective way to achieve this. One person can connect with stakeholders more easily than a group of lawyers, fostering a sense of relatability and empathy. The spokesperson can be the CEO, a company executive, or an individual considered well suited to represent the organisation. It is crucial to choose someone who possesses strong communication skills as their actions will have a significant impact on how key stakeholders respond to the situation. The ability of the spokesperson to humanise the company and present the mistakes as manageable plays a pivotal role in maintaining support from stakeholders. By having a designated spokesperson who can convey the human side of the company and address the mistakes with sincerity, the organisation showcases its accountability and willingness to learn from the situation. This approach cultivates transparency and builds trust with stakeholders, demonstrating the company s commitment to rectify any errors. It is an opportunity to exhibit the brand s integrity and strengthen relationships with the audience during challenging times. 2.10.2 Proactive Damage Control When developing a cyber crisis communication plan, proactive damage control should be a cornerstone of the cyber crisis communication strategy. It involves taking pre emptive measures to minimise the impact of a crisis and mitigate potential risks. By adopting a proactive approach, the organisation can effectively address vulnerabilities and enhance the organisation s resilience to cyber threats. One essential aspect of proactive damage control is conducting a comprehensive risk assessment. This assessment helps identify potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities specific to the 18  organisation. It involves evaluating the already existing cybersecurity measures, conducting penetration testing, and staying informed about emerging threats. By understanding these risks, the company can implement robust security measures that help prevent or mitigate the impact of a crisis. In addition to risk assessment, developing a thorough incident response plan is vital for proactive damage control. This plan outlines the necessary steps to be taken in the event of a cyber incident. It includes defining roles and responsibilities, establishing communication channels, and providing a framework for decision making and escalation. By having a well defined plan in place, the organisation can respond swiftly and effectively, minimising the impact on the organisation and stakeholders. Training and awareness programs also play a significant role in proactive damage control. Regularly educating employees about cybersecurity best practices empowers them to identify and report potential threats, practice good password hygiene, and adopt safe browsing habits. By fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness within the organisation, one can create a proactive line of defence against cyber threats. 2.10.3 Case Escalation Sometimes crises can be resolved on the individual level before they reach a viral tipping point. For these cases, it helps to create an escalation system within the organisation s customer service team that can diffuse the issue before it gets out of hand. When creating a cyber crisis communication plan, it is crucial to address and prevent the escalation of the situation. This requires a proactive and strategic approach to mitigate the potential damage and maintain control over the incident. First and foremost, a swift response and efficient incident management process are essential. Establish clear roles and responsibilities, along with defined escalation paths, to ensure that the incident is addressed promptly and effectively. Transparent and timely communication is another critical aspect. Keep stakeholders informed about the incident, its impact, and the steps being taken to mitigate it. Transparency helps build trust and reduces the likelihood of speculation and misinformation. Timely updates are crucial to prevent the situation from escalating due to a lack of information. Having a predefined list of companies those can assist in proactive damage control might come handy in case of cyber crisis wight significantly reducing response time. 19 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  Effective coordination and collaboration among internal teams, external partners, and stakeholders are vital in preventing escalation. Establish channels for communication and information sharing to facilitate a coordinated response. Leveraging the expertise, resources, and support of all relevant parties, the organisation can address the incident comprehensively and minimise the chances of it spiralling into a larger crisis. 2.10.4 Social Media Response Social media is a wonderful marketing tool that allows companies to reach audiences across the globe. But this reach works both ways, as customers can share stories, post pictures, and upload videos for the world to see. One viral video painting the company in the wrong light can lead to millions of people developing a negative perception of the brand. Crises are battled both in person and online. In order to cope with the challenges derived from the social media, the company needs a social media plan that can manage the digital buzz around the business or company. This may include assigning more representatives to monitor the company s social channels or updating followers with new information. However, it is utilised, social media cannot be disregarded when a company is navigating through a crisis. 2.10.5 Customer Feedback Collection and Analysis At times, companies may encounter a crisis that lacks public attention or social media virality. Instead, it silently impacts the company s customers and leads to churn, often due to insufficient feedback collection. Without gathering enough feedback from customers, the company may remain unaware of the issue s impact on the customer base. To address this challenge, it is crucial to prioritise customer feedback collection and analysis during a crisis. Actively seek feedback through various channels such as surveys, customer support interactions, and online platforms. Encourage customers to share their experiences and concerns openly, ensuring that their voices are heard. Once customer feedback is gathered, it is essential to analyse it effectively. Look for patterns, common themes, and emerging issues that could indicate the extent of the crisis s impact on customers. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the specific areas that need immediate attention and mitigation efforts. By identifying and addressing customer concerns promptly, the organisation can mitigate further churn and demonstrate the commitment to resolving the crisis. 20  EXECUTION OF THE PLAN PRINCIPLES FOR CRISIS COMMUNICATIONS Acknowledge the crisis Do not try to hide if when there is an incident developing, but be careful not to take ownership or responsibility for a crisis that is not the organisation s responsibility. Act swiftly and decisively As soon as the incident is identified, activate the crisis communication plan, delays lead to speculation, misinformation and reputational damage. Communicate what the organisation knows Provide factual information only, without judgment, emotion or guessing. Clear and Transparent Responses should be timely, accurate and consistency, despite the likely external media and stakeholder pressure. Show empathy It is important to express concern for any affected parties, whether internal or external take responsibility and apologise if it is demonstrably at fault. Action oriented Detail the steps being taken to remedy the situation and avoid it happening again in order to reassure key stakeholders. Provide perspective Place the situation into context. Tailor messages to different stakeholders provide each group with necessary information, guidance and support. Establish clear lines of communication Provide contact information, such as dedicated hotlines or email addresses, to facilitate communication and ensure that queries and concerns are addressed promptly. 3 21 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  Leverage social media and online platforms Monitor relevant hashtags and keywords to stay aware of public sentiment and address any emerging issues or misinformation proactively. Manage media effectively Maintain a proactive approach in managing media inquiries, providing accurate information, and promptly correcting any inaccuracies or misleading reports. Provide ongoing updates Acknowledge the need for ongoing communication to maintain engagement and reassure stakeholders that the issue is being addressed. Conduct Hot wash Cold wash exercises after the crisis is resolved to capture findings and comments. SOME PRACTICAL EXAMPLES Below is an example of a practical use case for cyber crisis communication management and the actions that could be taken for internal and external mitigation. Use Case A small manufacturing company s servers have been compromised by a ransomware attack, resulting in significant data loss and production downtime. Internal Mitigation Actions 1. Activate the cyber crisis communication team and establish a clear chain of command. 2. Assess the severity of the incident and prioritise the response effort. 3. Notify employees of the incident and provide guidance on how to respond. 4. Work with the IT team to isolate infected machines and restore data from backups. 5. Assess the impact on production and develop a plan to resume operations. 6. Conduct an internal investigation to determine the cause of the incident and identify any vulnerabilities in the company s IT infrastructure. 7. Provide regular updates to employees and stakeholders as the situation evolves. 22  External Mitigation Actions 1. Notify customers and suppliers of the incident and provide guidance on any impact on their operations. 2. Contact law enforcement and report the incident. 3. Work with legal counsel to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and other legal requirements. 4. Draft and disseminate public statements to media outlets and manage media relations. 5. Monitor social media channels and respond to inquiries from stakeholders. 6. Notify insurance providers and work with them to file a claim. 7. Conduct a post incident review to identify areas for improvement in the response plan. By following these internal and external mitigation actions, the small manufacturing company can effectively manage the impact of the ransomware attack on their operations and reputation.

EXERCISING THE PLAN To effectively exercise a cyber crisis communication plan, organisations may consider the following types of exercises that vary in scale and stakeholder involvement. Tabletop Exercises Tabletop exercises are discussion based exercises that simulate a crisis scenario in a controlled environment. They involve key stakeholders, such as members of the crisis communication team, senior management, IT personnel, and legal representatives. Participants discuss and analyse hypothetical scenarios, review the communication plan, and practice making decisions and coordinating communication efforts. 24  Functional Exercises Functional exercises involve more active participation and simulate the operational response to a cyber crisis. They typically include a wider range of participants internal and external . The exercise scenario unfolds gradually, allowing participants to engage in real time decision making, communication, and coordination activities. Full Scale Exercises Full scale exercises involve a comprehensive simulation of a cyber crisis scenario, often conducted in a realistic setting and with a broader range of participants. This may include representatives from multiple departments within the organisation, external partners, vendors, and relevant authorities. Full scale exercises aim to replicate a real life crisis situation as closely as possible, including aspects such as media engagement, public response, and stakeholder interaction. In the event that the organisation already possesses a well established framework for conducting cyber incident management exercises, it is advisable to broaden the scope of these exercises to incorporate scenarios related to communication planning. This inclusion allows participants to gain a comprehensive understanding of the overall incident management process, including the activation of the crisis communication plan. It is considered as a good practice to invite external observers to oversee the conduct of the exercise. An observer can assist in evaluating the performance, assessing gaps and point to the areas that would require fine tunning. This observer is not necessarily a consultant, but rather a communication expert or someone with experience in the area of crisis management. Possible exercise scenarios 1. The email service is not accessible or untrusted, compromised Objective To practice effective communication and collaboration within the team when the company s email system is not accessible. Simulation Exercise participants simulate a scenario where an important announcement needs to be communicated to the public during the email outage. Each expert should apply their chosen communication methods and strategy to effectively convey the message. 25 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  2. The Organisation s general communication channels teams, slack, yammer are not available Objective To practice effective communication and teamwork when the organisation s general communication channels e.g., Teams, Slack, Yammer are not available. Simulation Exercise participants simulate a scenario where a cyber crisis is ongoing, and critical information promptly needs to be discussed, disseminated within the team and shared to stakeholders. Each expert should apply their chosen communication methods and strategy to effectively convey the information. 3. Incident happens in the middle of holiday period Objective To exercise the backup and alternate system Simulation Exercise participants simulate a scenario where a cyber crisis is ongoing during a holyday period and some of the key stakeholders and members of the crisis communication team are on vacation and unavailable. 4. Organisation s assets network, laptop, communication channels are inaccessible Objective To find alternative ways of communication and information sharing. Simulation Exercise participants simulate a scenario where due to a cyber crisis the organisation s assets are not available for use. Exercise participants must find a common agreement which alternative means of communication to be used and how to disseminate important information internally and externally in a timely manner. 26  LESSONS LEARNT AND LINES TO TAKE After executing the cyber crisis communication plan, it is crucial to conduct a thorough review and gather feedback to learn valuable lessons and make necessary adjustments. Below there are some steps an organisation can take to gather feedback, analyse it, and adapt the cyber crisis communication plan accordingly. Conduct Post Incident Review As soon as the cyber crisis has been resolved, gather the crisis communication team and other relevant stakeholders to conduct a post incident review. This review should assess the effectiveness of the communication efforts and identify areas for improvement. Gather Feedback from Internal Stakeholders Collect feedback from the internal stakeholders, including members of the crisis communication team, IT department, executive management, and other relevant departments. Their insights can provide valuable perspectives on what worked well and what could be improved. Seek Feedback from External Stakeholders Engage with external stakeholders, such as customers, partners, regulatory authorities, and the media, to gather their feedback. This can be done through surveys, interviews, or focus groups. Their feedback will help to understand their perception of the company s communication efforts and identify any gaps or areas that need attention. Analyse Media Coverage Monitor media coverage of the cyber incident and the organisation s response. Analyse how the incident was portrayed, the accuracy of information, and any criticisms or concerns raised. This analysis will help to identify areas where the applied communication can be strengthened or clarified. 27 CYBER CRISIS COMMUNICATION GUIDE  Monitor Social Media and Online Platforms Keep an eye on social media platforms, online forums, and other relevant online spaces where discussions about the cyber incident may have taken place. Analyse sentiment, identify misinformation, and respond to any emerging issues or concerns. This feedback can provide insights into public perception and areas where communication can be enhanced. Review Metrics and Analytics Assess the performance metrics and analytics associated with the applied communication efforts. This includes evaluating the reach and engagement of the communication channels, such as website traffic, social media metrics, email open rates, and click through rates. Analyse these data points to understand how the intended messages were received and whether adjustments are needed. Update the Cyber Crisis Communication Plan Incorporate the lessons learned and feedback into the existing cyber crisis communication plan. Revise and update the plan, ensuring that it reflects the new information gathered and addresses any identified areas for improvement. This may involve updating key messages, communication channels, internal procedures, or protocols. Provide Training and Awareness Communicate the updates and revisions to the cyber crisis communication plan to the relevant stakeholders within the organisation. Conduct training sessions, workshops, or awareness campaigns to ensure that everyone involved understands the changes and their roles in implementing them. Continuously Review and Improve Treat the updated cyber crisis communication plan as a living document. Regularly review and evaluate its effectiveness, taking into account emerging threats, changes in the cybersecurity landscape, and new best practices. Iterate and refine the plan to ensure its ongoing relevance and effectiveness. 28  ANNEXES ANNEX I.
