The National Measurement Institute NMI is a division of the department. It maintains Australia s measurement system by administering the National Measurement Act 1960 the Act . The Act establishes a national system of units and standards of measurement provides for their uniform use throughout Australia to ensure traceability of measurement regulates measurement based transactions, including sales of measured quantities and packaged goods sets out specific requirements for measuring instruments used for trade. Regulation of measurement Legal metrology refers to the legislative and regulatory framework that underpins measurements and measuring instruments used for trade and legal purposes. Consistency and certainty in measurement supports fair and open competition by providing a level playing field for businesses. This ensures that market participants of all sizes and financial strengths follow the same rules and have equal opportunity to compete. Organisations trade more than 1 trillion worth of goods, services and utilities involving measurement in Australia each year. Reliable measurements help consumers and businesses make informed buying decisions. More broadly, this supports efficient markets. Reducing regulatory burdens for industry can lower costs to businesses and encourage innovation. It is also important that the regulatory environment strikes the right balance between efficient markets and community expectations. To support this, NMI s regulatory approach aligns with the 3 principles of the government s Regulator Performance Guide. The National Measurement Institute Compliance Policy includes further information on our regulatory approach.
