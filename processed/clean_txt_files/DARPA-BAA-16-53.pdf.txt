Funding Opportunity Description DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the areas of machine learning and human computer interaction. The goal of Explainable Artificial Intelligence XAI is to create a suite of new or modified machine learning techniques that produce explainable models that, when combined with effective explanation techniques, enable end users to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of Artificial Intelligence AI systems. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. This Broad Agency Announcement BAA is being issued, and any resultant selection will be made, using procedures under Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 35.016. Any negotiations and or awards will use procedures under FAR 15.4 or 32 CFR 22 for grants and cooperative agreements. Proposals received as a result of this BAA shall be evaluated in accordance with evaluation criteria specified herein through a scientific review process. DARPA BAAs are posted on the Federal Business Opportunities FBO website and, as applicable, the Grants.gov website The following information is for those wishing to respond to this BAA. A. Introduction Dramatic success in machine learning has led to an explosion of new AI capabilities. Continued advances promise to produce autonomous systems that perceive, learn, decide, and act on their own. These systems offer tremendous benefits, but their effectiveness will be limited by the machine s inability to explain its decisions and actions to human users. This issue is especially important for the Department of Defense DoD , which is facing challenges that demand the development of more intelligent, autonomous, and symbiotic systems. Explainable AI will be essential if users are to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage this incoming generation of artificially intelligent partners. The problem of explainability is, to some extent, the result of AI s success. In the early days of AI, the predominant reasoning methods were logical and symbolic. These early systems reasoned by performing some form of logical inference on somewhat human readable symbols. Early systems could generate a trace of their inference steps, which then became the basis for explanation. As a result, there was significant work on how to make these systems explainable Shortliffe Buchanan, 1975 Swartout, Paris, Moore, 1991 Johnson, 1994 Lacave DÃ­ez, 2002 Van Lent, Fisher, Mancuso, 2004 . Yet these early systems were much less effective they proved too expensive to build and were too brittle against the complexities of the real world. Success came as researchers developed new techniques that employed machine learning to construct models of the world in their own internal representations. These new techniques include support vector machines, random forests, probabilistic graphical models, reinforcement learning, and deep learning neural networks. Although these more opaque models are more effective, they are less explainable.  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 6 DARPA is interested in creating technology to make this new generation of AI systems explainable. Because the most critical and most opaque components are based on machine learning, XAI is focusing on the development of explainable machine learning techniques. By creating new machine learning methods to produce more explainable models and combining them with explanation techniques, XAI aims to help users understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of AI systems. B. Program Scope The target of XAI is an end user who depends on decisions, recommendations, or actions produced by an AI system, and therefore needs to understand the rationale for the system s decisions. For example, an intelligence analyst who receives recommendations from a big data analytics algorithm needs to understand why the algorithm has recommended certain activity for further investigation. Similarly, a test operator of a newly developed autonomous system will need to understand why the system makes its decisions so that he she can decide how to use it in future missions. Figure 1 illustrates the XAI concept to provide end users with an explanation of individual decisions, enable users to understand the system s overall strengths and weaknesses, convey an understanding of how the system will behave in the future, and perhaps how to correct the system s mistakes. Figure 1 XAI Concept This concept presents three related research and development challenges 1 how to produce more explainable models 2 how to design the explanation interface and 3 how to understand the psychological requirements for effective explanations. For the first development challenge, the XAI program envisions developing a range of new or modified machine learning techniques to produce more explainable models. For the second development challenge, the program anticipates integrating state of the art human computer interaction HCI techniques e.g., visualization, language understanding, language generation, and dialog management with new  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 7 principles, strategies, and techniques to generate effective explanations. For the third development challenge, XAI plans to summarize, extend, and apply current psychological theories of explanation to assist both the XAI developers and evaluator. The program will be structured to ask for multiple development teams under Technical Area 1 to address the first and second challenges by developing an explainable learning system that contains both an explainable model and an explanation interface, and one team under Technical Area 2 to address the third challenge. B.1. Explainable Models The XAI program would like to improve explainability while maintaining a high level of learning performance for a range of machine learning techniques. There is an inherent tension between machine learning performance predictive accuracy and explainability often the highest performing methods e.g., deep learning are the least explainable, and the most explainable e.g., decision trees are less accurate. The program plans to fund a variety of machine learning techniques to provide future developers with a range of design options covering the performance versus explainability trade space. Explainable models might be created by learning to associate explanatory semantic information with features of the model, by learning simpler models that are easier to explain, by learning richer models that contain more explanatory content, or by inferring approximate models solely for the purpose of explanation. Recent research offers examples of promising directions, even though none of these examples provides a complete solution, nor are these considered the only possible solutions. Here are three possible strategies to illustrate the range, but not the entire space, of approaches that may be pursued Deep Explanation Develop modified or hybrid deep learning techniques that learn more explainable features, explainable representations, or explanation generation facilities. There are a number of design choices that affect deep learning the selection of training data, initial conditions, architectural layers, loss functions, regularization, optimization techniques, and training sequences. These design choices might be engineered to produce more explainable representations. Recent work has made several small steps towards explainability. Researchers have used deconvolutional networks to visualize the layers of convolutional networks Zeiler Fergus, 2014 . There are a variety of techniques for associating semantic concepts with nodes of a deep network, such as those used to identify items in a visual scene and recount multimedia events Yu, Liu, Cheng, Divakaran, Sawhney, 2012 Gan, Wang, Yang, Yeung, Hauptmann, 2015 . Moreover, it might be possible to extend the approaches used to generate image captions LeCun, Bengio, Hinton, 2015 to train a second deep network to generate explanations without explicitly identifying the sematic features of the original network Hendricks et al., 2016 . Because deep learning is so prominent, it is important for the XAI program to pursue several approaches to make these systems more explainable. Interpretable Models Develop alternative machine learning techniques that learn more structured, interpretable, or causal models. There is a wide variety of techniques that may be pursued learning simpler, more compact models, such as Bayesian Rule Lists Letham, Rudin, McCormick, Madigan, 2015 learning richer, more conceptual, generative models, such as Bayesian Program Learning Lake, Salakhutdinov, Tenenbaum, 2015 learning models of causal relationships Maier, Taylor, Oktay, Jensen, 2010 using stochastic grammars to learn more interpretable structure Brendel  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 8 Todorovic, 2011 Park, Nie, Zhu 2016 or many others. Because these techniques are inherently more explainable even if their performance is less than optimal , it is important for the XAI program to also pursue promising techniques for learning interpretable models. Model Induction Develop techniques that would experiment with any given machine learning model as a black box to infer an approximate, explainable model. Ribeiro, Singh, Guestrin 2016 demonstrate an example of such a model agnostic explanation system that infers explanations by observing and analyzing the input output behavior of the original black box model. Moreover, it may be possible to develop richer model agnostic techniques by using abduction, reasoning, and story generation to rationalize plausible explanations of the system s reasoning. Because these techniques could apply to almost any machine learning application, it is important for the XAI program to also pursue promising techniques for model induction. B.2. Explanation Interface DARPA anticipates the design and development of effective interfaces by integrating state of the art HCI techniques with new strategies for presenting understandable explanations. Kulesza, Burnett, Wong, Stumpf 2015 provide an example of the development and evaluation of a basic explanation interface. The work followed a complete development strategy that included identifying principles of explainability, developing a prototype interface from those principles, and evaluating the effectiveness of the explanations provided by the prototype. It was basic in the sense that the system explained a very simple machine learning model, a naÃ¯ve Bayesian text classifier. The XAI program is seeking developments that go beyond this work by explaining more complex learning systems, by devising additional explanation strategies, and by applying more sophisticated HCI techniques where appropriate. The design of an effective explanation interface should consider a range of HCI and cognitive science techniques. This would certainly include basic user interface design, but XAI is interested in user interaction in the broadest sense. The design of the interface should consider the user s cognitive tasks and mental model of the system being explained. It should consider possible principles, such as the ones mentioned in Kulesza, Burnett, Wong, Stumpf 2015 , and possible strategies, such as explanation by example or analogy. It should consider the appropriate use of visualization and natural language understanding. Furthermore, it should include an explanation dialog to allow the user to interact with and drill down into the explanation. XAI is interested in a broad range of HCI and cognitive science techniques that will produce the most effective explanations. Moreover, DARPA believes it is important to develop the explanation interface in conjunction with explainable models as a part of an integrated system. Breakthroughs are more likely to come from the right combination of machine learning and HCI. The XAI program encourages a dialog between these two research communities and believes that effective XAI systems will depend on significant interaction and contribution from both research groups. The program will be asking for proposals that jointly develop explainable models and explanation interfaces in an integrated explainable learning system. XAI emphasizes the development of new modified machine learning techniques to produce explainable models. However, it is also possible for a well designed explanation interface to work with existing machine learning techniques to make those models more explainable.  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 9 Developers are encouraged to design and implement explanation interfaces that cover as wide a range of machine learning techniques as possible, old and new. B.3. Psychology of Explanation In addition to the application of psychology to the design of the explanation interface, the program is interested in work focused primarily on psychological theories of explanation. For example, there is relevant psychological research on the structure and function of explanation Lombrozo, 2006 and its role in learning and reasoning Lombrozo, 2012 . XAI in interested in having this work summarized and consolidated to inform both the development of the explainable learning systems by the developers and the definition of explanation effectiveness measures by the evaluator. XAI is particularly interested in the development of computational models of these theories that could be used to understand, model, and predict explanation effectiveness. B.4. Emphasis and Scope of XAI Research The XAI program is interested in new technology at the intersection of machine learning, HCI, and the psychology of explanation Figure 2 . XAI is not interested in research unrelated to the specific problem of explainable AI. For example, designing an effective explanation dialog may involve aspects of user modeling, personalization, and theory of mind, but XAI is not interested in research on these topics for the sake of that research alone. Similarly, there are many interesting research problems related to interactive machine learning and visual analytics, but XAI is most interested in research directly related to the problem of explaining machine learning models to end users. Figure 2 XAI Emphasis  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 10 C. Challenge Problems and Evaluation C.1. Overview The XAI program will focus the development of explainable learning systems on addressing challenge problems in two areas 1 machine learning problems to classify events of interest in heterogeneous, multimedia data, and 2 machine learning problems to construct decision policies for a simulated autonomous system. These two challenge problem areas, illustrated in Figure 3, were chosen to represent the intersection of two important machine learning approaches classification and reinforcement learning and two important operational problem areas for DoD intelligence analysis and autonomous systems . Figure 3 XAI Challenge Problem Areas The government will provide an evaluator and is not soliciting proposals for the evaluation role. The program is structured in two phases Phase 1, Technology Demonstrations 18 months and Phase 2, Comparative Evaluations 30 months . During Phase 1, developers will demonstrate their technology against their own test problems. During Phase 2, developers will test their technology against common problems defined by the government evaluator. Proposals for TA1 and TA2 should reflect a four year base program effort and a nominal start date of May 1, 2017. Each proposal may address either TA1 or TA2, but not both. Organizations may submit separate proposals to TA1 and TA2 and could possibly receive awards under both. Developers should propose their own test problems, within one or both of two general areas listed above, to work on during Phase 1 of the program. During Phase 2 of the program, developers will be asked to demonstrate their XAI systems against a set of common test  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 11 problems defined by the XAI government evaluator. During Phase 1, the XAI government evaluator will work with XAI developers to define a set of common test problems, in each of these challenge problem areas, to be used in Phase 2. The exact number and nature of the Phase 2 problems will depend on the technical approaches and test problems proposed by the selected XAI performers. Proposers should suggest creative and compelling test problems that would be the most productive drivers of XAI research and development. The program seeks test problems that are sufficiently general and compelling to be useful for multiple XAI approaches in order to avoid having a unique, tailored problem for each research project. Below, we describe the motivation and desired characteristics of these problems to inform proposer s selection of test problems for Phase 1. C.2. Data Analysis The choice of a data analytics challenge is motivated by a common problem in intelligence analysis analysts are presented with decisions and recommendations from big data analytics algorithms and must decide which items to pursue with more resources or which items to report as supporting evidence in their analysis. These algorithms often produce false alarms that the analyst must prune, and are subject to model drift that the analyst must detect. Furthermore, these algorithms often recommend items that the analyst must spend time assessing to determine if the evidence supports or contradicts hypotheses they are evaluating. Effective explanations would greatly help with all of these tasks. Ideally, test problems in this area will emphasize machine learning to classify items, events, or patterns of interest in heterogeneous, multimedia data, which would include structured or semi structured data, in addition to images and video. XAI is interested in problems that involve both video as well as other types of data, and that require meaningful explanations that are not obvious in the video alone. Although the main problem would involve supervised classification, unsupervised techniques might be very useful to organize the data into meaningful categories for explanation. A variety of candidate data sets and open test problems exist, including those provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST , the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining KDD conference, Kaggle, and other published data sets and test problems. Proposers interested in this problem area should describe their version of the challenge problem to include the data sets, training data, classification function to be learned, types of explanation to be provided, and user decisions to be supported. C.3. Autonomy The choice of an autonomy challenge is motivated by the question of how to effectively manage the incoming generation of artificially intelligent partners. For example, in the future DoD is likely to develop, test, and use a variety of autonomous systems. There will be test pilots or operators who will conduct operational tests and evaluations to determine how and when to use these systems in future missions. Operational conditions often vary from the original design specifications. There will be opportunities to use these systems for unanticipated mission scenarios. Test operators will need explanations to effectively make those determinations.  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 12 Ideally, test problems in this area will emphasize the use of reinforcement learning to learn sequential decision policies for the autonomous agent. However, because the decision machinery is likely to include additional planning, decision, or control modules, DARPA anticipates that these explanations may cover those reasoning modules, as well as decision policies learned through reinforcement learning. Moreover, the program is interested in explaining decisions that would be meaningful to the end user e.g., the test operator . Reinforcement learning might also be used to learn low level motor control, as well as higher level decisions. XAI is most interested in explanations of higher level decisions that would be relevant to the end user and the missions he she needs to manage. DARPA is considering simulation environments such as the ArduPilot Software in the Loop SITL environment, Research Environment for Supervising Control of Heterogeneous Unmanned Vehicles RESCHU , and those available from the OpenAI Gym for reinforcement learning. Proposers interested in this problem area should describe their version of the challenge problem to include the simulation environment, the types of missions to be covered, the decision policies and mission tasks to be learned, the type of explanations to be provided, and the user decisions to be supported. C.4. Expected Evaluation Sequence The general evaluation sequence to be administered by the government evaluator for the Phase 2 problems, in both challenge problem areas should be as follows. Proposals for Phase 1 test problems should use this sequence as a model, but may vary to provide a more effective development progression. 1. XAI developers are presented with a problem domain that includes training data or a simulated training environment and a description of the tasks that might be included in the final user test. The specific problems presented should vary to avoid over engineering and to provide a progression of increasing difficulty. 2. XAI developers are asked to apply their machine learning technique to learn an explainable model to accomplish those tasks. The evaluator may require some light instrumentation of this process to estimate the person hours and other resources required to learn the model. The program understands that some human involvement may be needed during the learning process, but encourages developers to avoid depending on a human intensive knowledge engineering effort. 3. The resulting explainable model is combined with the XAI developer s explanation interface to construct an explainable system. 4. The explainable system delivers and explains decisions or actions from the learned model while the user is performing related domain tasks. 5. The system s decisions and explanations contribute positively or negatively to the user s performance of the domain related tasks. 6. The evaluator measures the learning performance e.g., predictive accuracy of the model to accomplish the target tasks and the effectiveness of the explanations in helping the user understand and manage the AI system. 7. The evaluator also conducts evaluations of existing machine learning techniques, with a basic user interface, to establish baseline measurements for learning performance and explanation effectiveness against the target challenge problem. Measuring explanation effectiveness is a research challenge in its own right. XAI developers should propose their own measurement scheme to use in conjunction with their proposed test  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 13 problems for Phase 1. During that first phase, the XAI government evaluator will work with the XAI developers to define more detailed test problems and evaluation metrics to be used in the second phase of the program. Figure 4 shows the framework and initial ideas for measuring explanation effectiveness. The list of measures roughly represents increasing difficulty and sophistication. The most basic capability would explain a model s individual decisions. A more advanced capability would explain the strengths and weaknesses of the overall model. The most sophisticated capability would enable the user to identify and correct mistakes. It may not be possible to achieve all of these desired capabilities, especially the capability to correct mistakes, which would be beyond the reach of most current machine learning techniques. This list represents the ideal capabilities of an explanation system. In addition, the evaluator will define a range of evaluation techniques from fully automated to human intensive. XAI envisions three levels of evaluation 1 fully automated techniques that developers can use immediately and often to evaluate the system s explanations 2 Amazon Mechanical Turk AMT techniques that developers can use less frequently perhaps monthly to obtain some human evaluation of their system s explanations and 3 human in the loop techniques that developers can use annually for more intensive human evaluations while performing more complex tasks. Figure 4 Evaluation Framework for Measuring Explanation Effectiveness  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 14 D. Technical Areas Figure 5 shows the overall structure of the program. XAI shall be organized into two technical areas TAs Explainable Learners and Psychological Models of Explanation. As mentioned in Section C.1. Overview, DARPA is not soliciting proposals for the evaluator role. Proposers may propose to either or both of the technical areas Figure 5 XAI Program Structure Technical Area 1 TA1 Explainable Learners Multiple TA1 teams will develop prototype explainable learning systems. Each prototype should include both a machine learning technique that produces an explainable model and an explanation interface that will deliver useful explanations to an end user. TA1 proposers should include the following topics among those discussed in their proposal. This list will be evaluated as part of the Overall Science and Technical Merit of TA1 proposals Challenge Problem Area Select one or both of the challenge problems areas, data analytics or autonomy, to work on in both Phase 1 and Phase 2. Describe the proposed test problem s to work on in Phase 1, including the data sets or simulation environment, training data, functions to be learned, types of explanation to be provided, and user decisions to be supported. Explainable Model Describe the proposed machine learning approach for learning more explainable models. Describe the scope of the learning problems that would be handled by this approach. Describe the learning process. What training data is required What human involvement is required Propose how to measure learning performance and explainability of the learned models The proposed machine learning techniques may follow any of the three strategies described earlier deep explanation, interpretable models, or model induction , any combination of the three, or something completely different. It is acceptable to propose a range of machine learning techniques, especially if this widens the scope of machine learning problems covered by the proposer s approach. Explanation Interface Describe the approach for building the explanation interface. What are the initial design ideas for this interface What principles or design  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 15 strategies will be employed Describe examples of the explanations the system will generate. Describe the range of the machine learning models that could be explained by this approach. It is understood that the explanation interface may be developed through iterative prototyping with users. Nevertheless, proposers should describe their initial ideas for designing the first iteration of the explanation interface. Development Progression Describe the development sequence proposers intend to follow. What capabilities would proposers expect to develop during each phaseof the program It is understood that this progression is likely to change, but proposers should describe the capabilities of the final system they hope to produce by the end of the program and the interim capabilities they expect to develop along the way. Test and Evaluation Plan How will proposers test and evaluate their work in the first phase of the program How will proposers measure learning performance and explanation effectiveness If the test problem requires some government provided data or infrastructure, specify that in the proposal. Technical Area 2 TA2 Psychological Model of Explanation DARPA plans to fund at least one TA2 performer to provide expertise in the psychology of explanation. This performer will summarize current psychological theories of explanation, relevant to a XAI system, in an information package to assist the TA1 developers and the government evaluator. This summary may include recommendations on theories the performer believes are most useful for XAI. The TA2 performer will then develop a computational model of explanation from those theories that could be used to predict explanation effectiveness of XAI systems. The TA2 performer would also provide advice and consultation to the TA1 developers on the requirements for an effective explanation and to the XAI government evaluator regarding the development of metrics to measure explanation effectiveness. TA2 proposers should include the following topics among those discussed in their proposal. This list will be evaluated as part of the Overall Science and Technical Merit of TA2 proposals Theories of Explanation Summarize the current psychological theories of explanation and describe how to further develop and refine this summary. Describe how this work will inform the development of the TA1 XAI systems. Describe how this work will inform the definition of the evaluation framework for measuring explanation effectiveness by the XAI evaluator. Computational Model Describe how to develop and implement a computational model of explanation from the available theories. Describe how to model elements of the theory. Identify predictions that might be tested with the computational model. Explain how to test and refine the model. Model Validation Describe how to validate the computational model of the theory and how to test the model against the TA1 evaluation results in Phase 2 of the XAI program.

Government furnished Property Equipment Information DARPA and the evaluation team will manage a demonstration evaluation infrastructure described in Section C. Challenge Problems and Evaluation. During Phase 2 of the program, the XAI government evaluator will provide test data, problem definitions, evaluation infrastructure including AMT, other human subjects, and IRB approvals , and data analysis of the evaluation results. During Phase 1 of the program, the XAI government evaluator may provide assistance as needed. Proposers should describe any assistance they expect to be provided by the XAI government evaluator during Phase 1. H. Intellectual Property The program will emphasize creating and leveraging open source technology and architecture. A key goal of the program is to establish an open, standards based, multi source, plug and play architecture that allows for interoperability and integration. This includes the ability to easily add, remove, substitute, and modify software and hardware components. This will facilitate rapid innovation by providing a base for future users or developers of program technologies and  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 18 deliverables. Therefore, it is desired that all noncommercial software including source code , software documentation, hardware designs and documentation, and technical data generated by the program be provided as deliverables to the Government, with a minimum of Government Purpose Rights GPR , as lesser rights may adversely impact the lifecycle costs of affected items, components, or processes. Intellectual property rights asserted by proposers are strongly encouraged to be aligned with open source regimes. See Section VI.B.1 for more details on intellectual property. I.

Awards Multiple awards are anticipated. The level of funding for individual awards made under this solicitation has not been predetermined and will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. Awards will be made to proposers whose proposals are determined to be the most advantageous to the Government, all factors considered, including the potential contributions of the proposed work, overall funding strategy, and availability of funding. See Section V for further information. The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, one, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation make awards without discussions with proposers conduct discussions with proposers if it is later determined to be necessary segregate portions of resulting awards into pre priced options accept proposals in their entirety or to select only portions of proposals for award fund proposals in increments and or with options for continued work at the end of one or more phases request additional documentation once the award instrument has been determined e.g., representations and certifications and remove proposers from award consideration should the parties fail to reach agreement on award terms within a reasonable time or the proposer fails to provide requested additional information in a timely manner. Proposals selected for award negotiation may result in a procurement contract, cooperative agreement, or Other Transaction OT depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. In all cases, the Government contracting officer shall have sole discretion to select award instrument type and to negotiate all instrument terms and conditions with selectees. Proposers are advised that regardless of the instrument type proposed, DARPA personnel, in consultation with the Government contracting officer, may select other award instruments, as they deem appropriate. DARPA will apply publication or other restrictions, as necessary, if it determines that the research resulting from the proposed effort will present a high likelihood of disclosing performance characteristics of military systems or manufacturing technologies that are unique and critical to defense. Any award resulting from such a determination will include a requirement for DARPA permission before publishing any information or results on the program. For more information on publication restrictions, see the section below on Fundamental Research. B. Fundamental Research It is DoD policy that the publication of products of fundamental research will remain unrestricted to the maximum extent possible. National Security Decision Directive NSDD 189 established the national policy for controlling the flow of scientific, technical, and engineering information produced in federally funded fundamental research at colleges, universities, and laboratories. The Directive defines fundamental research as follows  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 21 Fundamental research means basic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons. As of the date of publication of this BAA, the Government expects that program goals as described herein may be met by proposers intending to perform fundamental research. The Government does not anticipate applying publication restrictions of any kind to individual awards for fundamental research that may result from this BAA. Notwithstanding this statement of expectation, the Government is not prohibited from considering and selecting research proposals that, while perhaps not qualifying as fundamental research under the foregoing definition, still meet the BAA criteria for submissions. If proposals are selected for award that offer other than a fundamental research solution, the Government will either work with the proposer to modify the proposed statement of work to bring the research back into line with fundamental research or else the proposer will agree to restrictions in order to receive an award. Proposers should indicate in their proposal whether they believe the scope of the research included in their proposal is fundamental or not. While proposers should clearly explain the intended results of their research, the Government shall have sole discretion to select award instrument type and to negotiate all instrument terms and conditions with selectees. Appropriate clauses will be included in resultant awards for non fundamental research to prescribe publication requirements and other restrictions, as appropriate. For certain research projects, it may be possible that although the research being performed by the prime contractor is restricted research, a subawardee may be conducting fundamental research. In those cases, it is the prime contractor s responsibility to explain in its proposal why its subawardee s effort is fundamental research. The following statement or similar provision will be incorporated into any resultant non fundamental research procurement contract or other transaction There shall be no dissemination or publication, except within and between the contractor and any subawardees, of information developed under this contract or contained in the reports to be furnished pursuant to this contract without prior written approval of DARPA s Public Release Center DARPA PRC . All technical reports will be given proper review by appropriate authority to determine which Distribution Statement is to be applied prior to the initial distribution of these reports by the contractor. With regard to subawardee proposals for Fundamental Research, papers resulting from unclassified fundamental research are exempt from prepublication controls and this review requirement, pursuant to DoD Instruction 5230.27 dated October 6, 1987. When submitting material for written approval for open publication, the contractor awardee must submit a request for public release to the DARPA PRC and include the following information 1 Document Information document title, document author, short plain language description of technology discussed in the material approx. 30 words , number of pages or minutes of video and document type e.g., briefing, report, abstract, article, or paper 2 Event Information event type conference,  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 22 principal investigator meeting, article or paper , event date, desired date for DARPA s approval 3 DARPA Sponsor DARPA Program Manager, DARPA office, and contract number and 4 Contractor Awardee s Information POC name, email and phone. Allow four weeks for processing due dates under four weeks require a justification. Unusual electronic file formats may require additional processing time. Requests may be sent either via email to public_release_center darpa.mil or by mail at 675 North Randolph Street, Arlington VA 22203 2114, telephone 571 218 4235. Refer to the following for link for information about DARPA s public release process with us contract management public release.  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 23 III. Eligibility Information A. Eligible Applicants All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government s needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA. Please note that FFRDC, government entity, and foreign participation is welcomed, however, some limitations may apply. Please see below. 1. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers FFRDCs and Government Entities Federally Funded Research and Development Centers FFRDCs and Government entities e.g., Government National laboratories, military educational institutions, etc. are subject to applicable direct competition limitations and cannot propose to this BAA in any capacity unless they meet the following conditions 1 FFRDCs must clearly demonstrate that the proposed work is not otherwise available from the private sector and 2 FFRDCs must provide a letter on official letterhead from their sponsoring organization citing the specific authority establishing their eligibility to propose to Government solicitations and compete with industry, and their compliance with the associated FFRDC sponsor agreement s terms and conditions. This information is required for FFRDCs proposing to be prime contractors or subawardees. Government entities must clearly demonstrate that the work is not otherwise available from the private sector and provide written documentation citing the specific statutory authority and contractual authority, if relevant, establishing their ability to propose to Government solicitations. At the present time, DARPA does not consider 15 U.S.C. 3710a to be sufficient legal authority to show eligibility. While 10 U.S.C. 2539b may be the appropriate statutory starting point for some entities, specific supporting regulatory guidance, together with evidence of agency approval, will still be required to fully establish eligibility. DARPA will consider FFRDC and Government entity eligibility submissions on a case by case basis however, the burden to prove eligibility for all team members rests solely with the proposer. 2. Foreign Participation Non U.S. organizations and or individuals may participate to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary nondisclosure agreements, security regulations, export control laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances. B. Procurement Integrity, Standards of Conduct, Ethical Considerations, and Organizational Conflicts of Interest Current federal employees are prohibited from participating in particular matters involving conflicting financial, employment, and representational interests 18 U.S.C. 203, 205, and 208 . Once the proposals have been received, and prior to the start of proposal evaluations, the Government will assess potential conflicts of interest and will promptly notify the proposer if any appear to exist. The Government assessment does NOT affect, offset, or mitigate the proposer s responsibility to give full notice and planned mitigation for all potential organizational conflicts, as discussed below.  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 24 Without prior approval or a waiver from the DARPA Director, in accordance with FAR 9.503, a contractor cannot simultaneously provide scientific, engineering, technical assistance SETA or similar support and also be a technical performer. As part of the proposal submission, all members of the proposed team prime proposers, proposed subawardees, and consultants must affirm whether they their organizations and individual team members are providing SETA or similar support to any DARPA technical office s through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office s the proposer, subawardees, consultant, or individual supports and identify the prime contract number s . All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest FAR 9.5 must be disclosed. The disclosure must include a description of the action the proposer has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. If in the sole opinion of the Government after full consideration of the circumstances, a proposal fails to fully disclose potential conflicts of interest and or any identified conflict situation cannot be effectively mitigated, the proposal will be rejected without technical evaluation and withdrawn from further consideration for award. If a prospective proposer believes a conflict of interest exists or may exist whether organizational or otherwise or has questions on what constitutes a conflict of interest, the proposer should send his her contact information and a summary of the potential conflict via email to the BAA email address before time and effort are expended in preparing a proposal and mitigation plan. C. Cost Sharing Matching Cost sharing is not required however, it will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument e.g., OTs under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 .

Classified Submission Instructions As a reminder, classified submissions classified technical proposals or classified appendices to unclassified proposals WILL NOT be accepted under this solicitation.  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 40 V. Application Review Information A. Evaluation Criteria Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance Overall Scientific and Technical Merit Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission and Cost Realism. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit The proposed technical approach is feasible, achievable, complete and supported by a proposed technical team that has the expertise and experience to accomplish the proposed tasks. The task descriptions and associated technical elements are complete and in a logical sequence, with all proposed deliverables clearly defined such that a viable attempt to achieve project goals is likely as a result of award. The proposal identifies major technical risks and clearly defines feasible mitigation efforts. Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission The potential contributions of the proposed effort are relevant to the national technology base. Specifically, DARPA s mission is to maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. military and prevent technological surprise from harming our national security by sponsoring revolutionary, high payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and their application. This includes considering the extent to which any proposed intellectual property restrictions will potentially impact the Government s ability to transition the technology. Cost Realism The proposed costs are realistic for the technical and management approach and accurately reflect the technical goals and objectives of the solicitation. The proposed costs are consistent with the proposer s Statement of Work and reflect a sufficient understanding of the costs and level of effort needed to successfully accomplish the proposed technical approach. The costs for the prime proposer and proposed subawardees are substantiated by the details provided in the proposal e.g., the type and number of labor hours proposed per task, the types and quantities of materials, equipment and fabrication costs, travel and any other applicable costs . B. Review and Selection Process The review process identifies proposals that meet the evaluation criteria described above and are, therefore, selectable for negotiation of awards by the Government. DARPA policy is to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive proposal evaluations and to select proposals that meet DARPA technical, policy, and programmatic goals. If necessary, panels of experts in the appropriate areas will be convened. As described in Section IV, proposals must be deemed conforming to the solicitation to receive a full technical review against the evaluation criteria proposals deemed non conforming will be removed from consideration. DARPA will conduct a scientific technical review of each conforming proposal. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 41 work statement. DARPA s intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons. Selections may be made at any time during the period of solicitation. Pursuant to FAR 35.016, the primary basis for selecting proposals for award negotiation shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and fund availability. Conforming proposals based on a previously submitted abstract will be reviewed without regard to feedback resulting from review of that abstract. Furthermore, a favorable response to an abstract is not a guarantee that a proposal based on the abstract will ultimately be selected for award negotiation. Proposals that are determined selectable will not necessarily receive awards. For evaluation purposes, a proposal is defined to be the document and supporting materials as described in Section IV.B. Subject to the restrictions set forth in FAR 37.203 d , input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non Government consultants experts who are strictly bound by the appropriate non disclosure requirements. No submissions, classified or unclassified, will be returned.  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 42 VI. Award Administration Information A. Selection Notices After proposal evaluations are complete, proposers will be notified as to whether their proposal was selected for award negotiation as a result of the review process. Notification will be sent by email to the technical and administrative POCs identified on the proposal cover sheet. If a proposal has been selected for award negotiation, the Government will initiate those negotiations following the notification. B. Administrative and National Policy Requirements 1. Intellectual Property Proposers should note that the Government does not own the intellectual property of technical data computer software developed under Government contracts it acquires the right to use the technical data computer software. Regardless of the scope of the Government s rights, performers may freely use their same data software for their own commercial purposes unless restricted by U.S. export control laws or security classification . Therefore, technical data and computer software developed under this solicitation will remain the property of the performers, though DARPA desires to have a minimum of Government Purpose Rights GPR to software developed through DARPA sponsorship. If proposers desire to use proprietary software or technical data or both as the basis of their proposed approach, in whole or in part, they should 1 clearly identify such software data and its proposed particular use s 2 explain how the Government will be able to reach its program goals including transition within the proprietary model offered and 3 provide possible nonproprietary alternatives in any area that might present transition difficulties or increased risk or cost to the Government under the proposed proprietary solution. Proposers expecting to use, but not to deliver, commercial open source tools or other materials in implementing their approach may be required to indemnify the Government against legal liability arising from such use. All references to Unlimited Rights or Government Purpose Rights are intended to refer to the definitions of those terms as set forth in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement DFARS Part 227. a. Intellectual Property Representations All proposers must provide a good faith representation of either ownership or possession of appropriate licensing rights to all other intellectual property to be used for the proposed project. Proposers must provide a short summary for each item asserted with less than unlimited rights that describes the nature of the restriction and the intended use of the intellectual property in the conduct of the proposed research. b. Patents All proposers must include documentation proving ownership or possession of appropriate licensing rights to all patented inventions to be used for the proposed project. If a patent application has been filed for an invention, but it includes proprietary information and is not  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 43 publicly available, a proposer must provide documentation that includes the patent number, inventor name s , assignee names if any , filing date, filing date of any related provisional application, and summary of the patent title, with either 1 a representation of invention ownership, or 2 proof of possession of appropriate licensing rights in the invention i.e., an agreement from the owner of the patent granting license to the proposer . c. Procurement Contracts Noncommercial Items Technical Data and Computer Software Proposers requesting a procurement contract must list all noncommercial technical data and computer software that it plans to generate, develop, and or deliver, in which the Government will acquire less than unlimited rights and to assert specific restrictions on those deliverables. In the event a proposer does not submit the list, the Government will assume that it has unlimited rights to all noncommercial technical data and computer software generated, developed, and or delivered, unless it is substantiated that development of the noncommercial technical data and computer software occurred with mixed funding. If mixed funding is anticipated in the development of noncommercial technical data and computer software generated, developed, and or delivered, proposers should identify the data and software in question as subject to GPR. In accordance with DFARS 252.227 7013, Rights in Technical Data Noncommercial Items, and DFARS 252.227 7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, the Government will automatically assume that any such GPR restriction is limited to a period of 5 years, at which time the Government will acquire unlimited rights unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government may use the list during the evaluation process to evaluate the impact of any identified restrictions and may request additional information from the proposer, as may be necessary, to evaluate the proposer s assertions. Failure to provide full information may result in a determination that the proposal is not compliant with the solicitation. A template for complying with this request is provided in Section IV.B.1.a.xii. 5 . Commercial Items Technical Data and Computer Software Proposers requesting a procurement contract must list all commercial technical data and commercial computer software that may be included in any noncommercial deliverables contemplated under the research project, and assert any applicable restrictions on the Government s use of such commercial technical data and or computer software. In the event a proposer does not submit the list, the Government will assume there are no restrictions on the Government s use of such commercial items. The Government may use the list during the evaluation process to evaluate the impact of any identified restrictions and may request additional information from the proposer to evaluate the proposer s assertions. Failure to provide full information may result in a determination that the proposal is not compliant with the solicitation. A template for complying with this request is provided in Section IV.B.1.a.xii. 5 . d. Other Types of Awards Proposers responding to this solicitation requesting an award instrument other than a  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 44 procurement contract shall follow the applicable rules and regulations governing those award instruments, but in all cases should appropriately identify any potential restrictions on the Government s use of any intellectual property contemplated under those award instruments in question. This includes both noncommercial items and commercial items. The Government may use the list as part of the evaluation process to assess the impact of any identified restrictions, and may request additional information from the proposer, to evaluate the proposer s assertions. Failure to provide full information may result in a determination that the proposal is not compliant with the solicitation. A template for complying with this request is provided in Section IV.B.1.a.xii. 5 . 2. Human Subjects Research All research selected for funding involving human subjects, to include use of human biological specimens and human data, must comply with the federal regulations for human subjects protection. Further, research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the DoD must comply with 32 CFR 219, Protection of Human Subjects and DoD Instruction 3216.02, Protection of Human Subjects and Adherence to Ethical Standards in DoD Supported Research Institutions awarded funding for research involving human subjects must provide documentation of a current Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for human subjects protection, such as a Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection Federal Wide Assurance All institutions engaged in human subjects research, to include subawardees, must also hold a valid Assurance. In addition, all personnel involved in human subjects research must provide documentation of completion of human subjects research training. For all proposed research that will involve human subjects in the first year or phase of the project, the institution must provide evidence of or a plan for review by an Institutional Review Board IRB upon final proposal submission to DARPA as part of their proposal, prior to being selected for funding. The IRB conducting the review must be the IRB identified on the institution s Assurance of Compliance with human subjects protection regulations. The protocol, separate from the proposal, must include a detailed description of the research plan, study population, risks and benefits of study participation, recruitment and consent process, data collection, and data analysis. It is recommended that you consult the designated IRB for guidance on writing the protocol. The informed consent document must comply with federal regulations 32 CFR 219.116 . A valid Assurance of Compliance with human subjects protection regulations along with evidence of completion of appropriate human subjects research training by all investigators and personnel involved with human subjects research should accompany the protocol for review by the IRB. In addition to a local IRB approval, a headquarters level human subjects administrative review and approval is required for all research conducted or supported by the DoD. The Army, Navy, or Air Force office responsible for managing the award can provide guidance and information about their component s headquarters level review process. Note that confirmation of a current Assurance of Compliance with human subjects protection regulations and appropriate human subjects research training is required before headquarters level approval can be issued.  DARPA BAA 16 53 EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XAI 45 The time required to complete the IRB review approval process varies depending on the complexity of the research and the level of risk involved with the study. The IRB approval process can last between one and three months, followed by a DoD review that could last between three and six months. Ample time should be allotted to complete the approval process. DoD DARPA funding cannot be used towards human subjects research until ALL approvals are granted. 3. Animal Use Award recipients performing research, experimentation, or testing involving the use of animals shall comply with the rules on animal acquisition, transport, care, handling, and use as outlined in i 9 CFR parts 1 4, Department of Agriculture rules that implement the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 2131 2159 ii National Institutes of Health Publication No. 86 23, Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 8th Edition and iii DoD Instruction 3216.01, Use of Animals in DoD Programs.
