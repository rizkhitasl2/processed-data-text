DIRECTIVE 2014 32 EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of measuring instruments recast Text with EEA relevance THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 2 , Whereas 1 Directive 2004 22 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on measuring instru ments 3 has been substantially amended 4 . Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity. 2 Regulation EC No 765 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products 5 lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the market surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries, and lays down the general principles of the CE marking. 3 Decision No 768 2008 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products 6 lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation in order to provide a coherent basis for revision or recasts of that legislation. Directive 2004 22 EC should be adapted to that Decision. 4 This Directive covers measuring instruments which are new to the Union market when they are placed on the market that is to say they are either new measuring instruments made by a manufacturer established in the Union or measuring instruments, whether new or second hand, imported from a third country. 5 Correct and traceable measuring instruments can be used for a variety of measurement tasks. Those responding to reasons of public interest, public health, safety and order, protection of the environment and the consumer, of levying taxes and duties and of fair trading, which directly and indirectly affect the daily life of citizens in many ways, may require the use of legally controlled measuring instruments. 6 This Directive should apply to all forms of supply, including distance selling. 7 Legal metrological control should not lead to barriers to the free movement of measuring instruments. The applicable provisions should be the same in all Member States and proof of conformity should be accepted throughout the Union. 8 Legal metrological control requires conformity with specified performance requirements. The performance requirements that the measuring instruments must meet should provide a high level of protection. The conformity assessment should provide a high level of confidence. 9 Member States should as a general rule prescribe legal metrological control. Where legal metrological control is prescribed, only measuring instruments complying with common performance requirements should be used. 10 The principle of optionality introduced by Directive 2004 22 EC allows Member States to exercise their right to decide whether or not to prescribe the use of the measuring instruments covered by this Directive. EN 29.3.2014 Official Journal of the European Union L 96 149 1 OJ C 181, 21.6.2012, p. 105. 2 Position of the European Parliament of 5 February 2014 not yet published in the Official Journal and decision of the Council of 20 February 2014. 3 OJ L 135, 30.4.2004, p. 1. 4 See Annex XIV, Part A. 5 OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30. 6 OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 82.   11 National specifications concerning the appropriate national requirements for use should not interfere with the provisions of this Directive on putting into use . 12 The performance of certain measuring instruments is particularly sensitive to the environment, in particular the electromagnetic environment. Immunity of measuring instruments to electromagnetic interference should form an integral part of this Directive and the immunity requirements of Directive 2004 108 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility 1 should therefore not apply. 13 In order to ensure the free circulation of measuring instruments in the Union, Member States should not impede the placing on the market and or putting into use of measuring instruments that carry the CE marking and supplementary metrology marking in accordance with the provisions of this Directive. 14 Member States should take appropriate action to prevent non complying measuring instruments from being placed on the market and or put into use. Adequate cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States is therefore necessary to ensure a Union wide effect of this objective. 15 Economic operators should be responsible for the compliance of measuring instruments with this Directive, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of the aspects of public interest covered by this Directive, and also to guarantee fair competition on the Union market. 16 All economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they make available on the market only measuring instruments which are in conformity with this Directive. It is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain. 17 In order to facilitate communication between economic operators, market surveillance authorities and consumers, Member States should encourage economic operators to include a website address in addition to the postal address. 18 The manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment should therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer. 19 It is necessary to ensure that measuring instruments from third countries entering the Union market comply with this Directive, and in particular that the appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to those measuring instruments. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure that the measuring instruments they place on the market comply with the requirements of this Directive and that they do not place on the market measuring instruments which do not comply with such requirements or present a risk. Provision should also be made for importers to make sure that conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that marking of measuring instruments and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent national auth orities. 20 When placing a measuring instrument on the market, every importer should indicate on the measuring instrument his name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which he can be contacted. Exceptions should be provided for in cases where the size or nature of the measuring instrument does not allow it. This includes cases where the importer would have to open the packaging to put his name and address on the measuring instrument. 21 The distributor makes a measuring instrument available on the market after it has been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer. The distributor should act with due care to ensure that its handling of the measuring instrument does not adversely affect the compliance of that instrument with this Directive. 22 Any economic operator that either places a measuring instrument on the market under his own name or trade mark or modifies a measuring instrument in such a way that compliance with of this Directive may be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer. 23 Distributors and importers, being close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by competent national authorities, and should be prepared to participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary information relating to the measuring instrument concerned. EN L 96 150 Official Journal of the European Union 29.3.2014 1 OJ L 390, 31.12.2004, p. 24.   24 Ensuring traceability of a measuring instrument throughout the whole supply chain helps to make market surveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient traceability system facilitates market surveillance authorities task of tracing economic operators who made non compliant measuring instruments available on the market. When keeping the information required under this Directive for the identification of other economic operators, economic operators should not be required to update such information in respect of other economic operators who have either supplied them with a measuring instrument or to whom they have supplied a measuring instrument. 25 This Directive should be limited to the expression of essential requirements that do not impede technical progress, preferably performance requirements. In order to facilitate conformity assessment with those requirements it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for measuring instruments which are in conformity with harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation EU No 1025 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European Standardisation 1 for the purpose of expressing detailed technical specifications of those requirements. 26 Regulation EU No 1025 2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where those standards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Directive. 27 The technical and performance specifications of inter nationally agreed normative documents may also comply, in part or in full, with the essential requirements laid down by this Directive. In those cases the use of these internationally agreed normative documents should be allowed as an alternative to the use of harmonised standards and, under specific conditions, give rise to a presumption of conformity. 28 Conformity with the essential requirements laid down by this Directive can also be provided by specifications that are not supplied by a harmonised standard or an inter nationally agreed normative document. The use of harmonised standards or internationally agreed normative documents should therefore be optional. 29 In order to enable economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that measuring instruments made available on the market comply with the essential requirements, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No 768 2008 EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, from the least to the most stringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensure inter sectoral coherence and to avoid ad hoc variants, conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules. However, it is necessary to adapt those modules in order to reflect specific aspects of metro logical control. 30 The conformity assessment of sub assemblies should be carried out in accordance with this Directive. If sub assemblies are made available on the market separately and independently of an instrument, their conformity assessment should be undertaken independently of the instrument concerned. 31 The state of the art in measurement technology is subject to constant evolution which may lead to changes in the needs for conformity assessments. Therefore, for each category of measuring instrument and, where appro priate, sub assemblies, there should be an appropriate procedure or a choice between different procedures of equivalent stringency. 32 Manufacturers should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide information required under this Directive on the conformity of a measuring instrument with this Directive and with other relevant Union harmonisation legislation. 33 To ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, the information required to identify all applicable Union acts should be available in a single EU declaration of conformity. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, that single EU declaration of conformity may be a dossier made up of relevant individual declarations of conformity. 34 The CE marking and the supplementary metrology marking, indicating the conformity of a measuring instrument, are the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. General principles governing the CE marking and its relationship to other markings are set out in Regu lation EC No 765 2008. Rules governing the affixing of the CE marking and the supplementary metrology marking should be laid down in this Directive. 35 In order to take account of differences in climatic conditions or of different levels of consumer protection that may apply at national level, it is necessary to establish environmental or accuracy classes as essential requirements. 36 Certain conformity assessment procedures set out in this Directive require the intervention of conformity assessment bodies, which are notified by the Member States to the Commission. EN 29.3.2014 Official Journal of the European Union L 96 151 1 OJ L 316, 14.11.2012, p. 12.   37 Experience has shown that the criteria set out in Directive 2004 22 EC that conformity assessment bodies have to fulfil to be notified to the Commission are not sufficient to ensure a uniformly high level of performance of notified bodies throughout the Union. It is, however, essential that all notified bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services. 38 If a conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised standards it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements set out in this Directive. 39 In order to ensure a consistent level of quality in the performance of conformity assessment of measuring instruments, it is also necessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies. 40 The system set out in this Directive should be comple mented by the accreditation system provided for in Regu lation EC No 765 2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification. 41 Transparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation EC No 765 2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements. 42 Conformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for the measuring instruments to be placed on the market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified and the monitoring of bodies already notified cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries. 43 It is necessary to increase the efficiency and transparency of the notification procedure and, in particular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable online notification. 44 Since notified bodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies. 45 In the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies. 46 In order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that rules on Union market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market provided for in Regulation EC No 765 2008 apply to measuring instruments covered by this Directive. This Directive should not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks. 47 Member States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that measuring instruments may be placed on the market only if, when properly stored and used for their intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, they do not endanger the health and safety of persons. Measuring instruments should be considered as non compliant with the essential requirements laid down in this Directive only under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, that is when such use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour. 48 Directive 2004 22 EC already provides for a safeguard procedure allowing the Commission to examine the justification for a measure taken by a Member State against measuring instruments it considers to be non compliant. In order to increase transparency and to reduce processing time, it is necessary to improve the existing safeguard procedure, with the view to making it more efficient and drawing on the expertise available in Member States. EN L 96 152 Official Journal of the European Union 29.3.2014   49 The existing system should be supplemented by a procedure under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to measuring instruments presenting a risk to aspects of public interest protection covered by this Directive. It should also allow market surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an early stage in respect of such measuring instru ments. 50 Where the Member States and the Commission agree as to the justification of a measure taken by a Member State, no further involvement of the Commission should be required, except where non compliance can be attributed to shortcomings of a harmonised standard or a normative document. 51 In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implemen tation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation EU No 182 2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission s exercise of implementing powers 1 . 52 The advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts requesting the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification. 53 The advisory procedure should also be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to the objections to the internationally agreed normative documents whose references have not yet been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, given that the relevant document has not yet led to the presumption of conformity with the applicable essential requirements. 54 The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to the objections to the internationally agreed normative documents whose references were already published in the Official Journal of the European Union and which a Member State or the Commission considers justified, given that such acts could have consequences on the presumption of conformity with the applicable essential requirements. 55 The examination procedure should also be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to compliant measuring instruments which present a risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of public interest protection. 56 In line with established practice, the committee set up by this Directive can play a useful role in examining matters concerning the application of this Directive raised either by its chair or by a representative of a Member State in accordance with its rules of procedure. 57 When matters relating to this Directive, other than its implementation or infringements, are being examined, i.e. in a Commission expert group, the European Parliament should in line with existing practice receive full information and documentation and, where appro priate, an invitation to attend such meetings. 58 The Commission should, by means of implementing acts and, given their special nature, acting without the appli cation of Regulation EU No 182 2011, determine whether measures taken by Member States in respect of non compliant measuring instruments are justified or not. 59 In order to take into account the developments in the measurement technology, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Func tioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to the instrument specific Annexes. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. 60 Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of national law adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that those rules are enforced. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 61 It is necessary to provide for reasonable transitional arrangements that allow the making available on the market and putting into use, without the need to comply with further product requirements, of measuring instruments that have already been placed on the market in accordance with Directive 2004 22 EC before the date of application of national measures trans posing this Directive. Distributors should therefore be able to supply measuring instruments that have been placed on the market, namely stock that is already in the distribution chain, before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive. EN 29.3.2014 Official Journal of the European Union L 96 153 1 OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13.   62 Since the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure that measuring instruments on the market fulfil the requirements providing for a high level of protection of the public interests covered by this Directive while guar anteeing the functioning of the internal market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. 63 The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier Directive. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directive. 64 This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law and the dates of application of the Directives set out in Annex XIV, Part B, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE CHAPTER 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Subject matter This Directive establishes the requirements that measuring instruments have to satisfy with a view to their being made available on the market and or put into use for the measuring tasks referred to in Article 3 1 .

Article 5 Applicability to sub assemblies Where instrument specific annexes lay down the essential requirements for sub assemblies, this Directive shall apply mutatis mutandis to such sub assemblies. Sub assemblies and measuring instruments may be assessed independently and separately for the purpose of establishing conformity. Article 6 Essential requirements A measuring instrument shall meet the essential requirements set out in Annex I and in the relevant instrument specific Annex. Member States may require, if it is needed for correct use of the instrument, the information referred to in point 9 of Annex I or in the relevant instrument specific Annexes to be provided in a language which can be easily understood by end users, as determined by the Member State in which the instrument is made available on the market.

EN 29.3.2014 Official Journal of the European Union L 96 155  3. A Member State may require a measuring instrument to satisfy provisions governing its putting into use that are justified by local climatic conditions. In such a case, the Member State shall choose appropriate upper and lower temperature limits from Table 1 of Annex I and may specify humidity conditions condensing or non condensing and whether the intended location of use is open or closed. 4. When different accuracy classes are defined for a measuring instrument a the instrument specific Annexes under the heading Putting into use may indicate the accuracy classes to be used for specific applications b in all other cases a Member State may determine the accuracy classes to be used for specific applications within the classes defined, subject to allowing the use of all accuracy classes on its territory. For the purposes of point a or point b , measuring instruments of a better accuracy class may be used if the owner so chooses. 5. At trade fairs, exhibitions, demonstrations or similar events, Member States shall not prevent the showing of measuring instruments not in conformity with this Directive, provided that a visible sign clearly indicates their non conformity and their non availability for making available on the market and or putting into use until they are brought into conformity. CHAPTER 2 OBLIGATIONS OF ECONOMIC OPERATORS Article 8 Obligations of manufacturers 1. When placing their measuring instruments on the market and or putting them into use, manufacturers shall ensure that they have been designed and manufactured in accordance with the essential requirements set out in Annex I and in the relevant instrument specific Annexes. 2. Manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation referred to in Article 18 and carry out the relevant conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 17 or have it carried out. Where compliance of a measuring instrument with the applicable requirements of this Directive has been demonstrated by that conformity assessment procedure, manufacturers shall draw up an EU declaration of conformity and affix the CE marking and the supplementary metrology marking. 3. Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity for 10 years after the measuring instrument has been placed on the market. 4. Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for series production to remain in conformity with this Directive. Changes in measuring instrument design or characteristics and changes in the harmonised standards, normative documents or in other technical specifications by reference to which conformity of a measuring instrument is declared shall be adequately taken into account. When deemed appropriate with regard to the performance of a measuring instrument, manufacturers shall carry out sample testing of measuring instruments made available on the market, investigate and, if necessary, keep a register of complaints, of non conforming measuring instruments and measuring instrument recalls, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring. 5. Manufacturers shall ensure that measuring instruments which they have placed on the market bear a type, batch or serial number or other element allowing their identification, or, where the size or nature of the measuring instrument does not allow it, that the required information is provided in a document accompanying the measuring instrument and on the packaging, if any, in accordance with point 9.2 of Annex I. 6. Manufacturers shall indicate on the measuring instrument their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted or, where that is not possible, in a document accompanying the measuring instrument and on the packaging, if any, in accordance with point 9.2 of Annex I. The address shall indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end users and market surveillance authorities. 7. Manufacturers shall ensure that the measuring instrument which they have placed on the market is accompanied by a copy of the EU Declaration of conformity and by instructions and information in accordance with point 9.3 of Annex I, in a language which can be easily understood by end users, as determined by the Member State concerned. Such instructions and information, as well as any labelling, shall be clear, under standable and intelligible. 8. Manufacturers who consider or have reason to believe that a measuring instrument which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Directive shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that measuring instrument into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appro priate. Furthermore, where the measuring instrument presents a risk, manufacturers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the measuring instrument available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non compliance and of any corrective measures taken. EN L 96 156 Official Journal of the European Union 29.3.2014  9. Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation in paper or electronic form necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the measuring instrument with this Directive, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by measuring instruments which they have placed on the market. Article 9 Authorised representatives 1. A manufacturer may, by a written mandate, appoint an authorised representative. The obligations laid down in Article 8 1 and the obligation to draw up technical documentation referred to in Article 8 2 shall not form part of the authorised representative s mandate. 2. An authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in the mandate received from the manufacturer. The mandate shall allow the authorised representative to do at least the following a keep the EU declaration of conformity and the technical documentation at the disposal of national market surveillance authorities for 10 years after the measuring instrument has been placed on the market b further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide that authority with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of a measuring instrument c cooperate with the competent national authorities, at their request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by measuring instruments covered by their mandate. Article 10 Obligations of importers 1. Importers shall place only compliant measuring instruments on the market. 2. Before placing a measuring instrument on the market and or putting a measuring instrument into use importers shall ensure that the appropriate conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 17 has been carried out by the manufacturer. They shall ensure that the manufacturer has drawn up the technical documentation, that the measuring instrument bears the CE marking and the supplementary metrology marking and is accompanied by a copy of the EU declaration of conformity and the required documents, and that the manufacturer has complied with the requirements set out in Article 8 5 and 6 . Where an importer considers or has reason to believe that a measuring instrument is not in conformity with the essential requirements set out in Annex I and in the relevant instrument specific Annexes, he shall not place the measuring instrument on the market or put it into use until it has been brought into conformity. Furthermore, where the measuring instrument presents a risk, the importer shall inform the manufacturer and the market surveillance authorities to that effect. 3. Importers shall indicate on the measuring instrument their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted or, where that is not possible, in a document accompanying the measuring instrument and on its packaging, if any, in accordance with point 9.2 of Annex I. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end users and market surveillance authorities. 4. Importers shall ensure that the measuring instrument is accompanied by instructions and information in accordance with point 9.3 of Annex I, in a language which can be easily understood by end users, as determined by the Member State concerned. 5. Importers shall ensure that, while a measuring instrument is under their responsibility, its storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its compliance with the essential requirements set out in Annex I and in the relevant instrument specific Annexes. 6. When deemed appropriate with regard to the performance of a measuring instrument, importers shall carry out sample testing of measuring instruments made available on the market, investigate, and, if necessary, keep a register of complaints, of non conforming measuring instruments and measuring instrument recalls, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring. 7. Importers who consider or have reason to believe that a measuring instrument which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Directive shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that measuring instrument into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appro priate. Furthermore, where the measuring instrument presents a risk, importers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the measuring instrument available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non compliance and of any corrective measures taken. 8.

The essential requirements that shall be met by measuring instruments are set out below and are supplemented, where appropriate, by specific instrument requirements in Annexes III to XII that provide more detail on certain aspects of the general requirements. The solutions adopted in the pursuit of the essential requirements shall take account of the intended use of the instrument and any foreseeable misuse thereof. DEFINITIONS Measurand The measurand is the particular quantity subject to measurement. Influence quantity An influence quantity is a quantity that is not the measurand but that affects the result of measurement. Rated Operating Conditions The rated operating conditions are the values for the measurand and influence quan tities making up the normal working conditions of an instrument. Disturbance An influence quantity having a value within the limits specified in the appropriate requirement but outside the specified rated operating conditions of the measuring instrument. An influence quantity is a disturbance if for that influence quantity the rated operating conditions are not specified. Critical change value The critical change value is the value at which the change in the measurement result is considered undesirable. Material Measure A material measure is a device intended to reproduce or supply in a permanent manner during its use one or more known values of a given quantity. Direct sales A trading transaction is direct sales if the measurement result serves as the basis for the price to pay and at least one of the parties involved in the transaction related to measurement is a consumer or any other party requiring a similar level of protection and all the parties in the transaction accept the measurement result at that time and place. Climatic environments Climatic environments are the conditions in which measuring instruments may be used. To cope with climatic differences between the Member States, a range of temperature limits has been defined. Utility A utility is regarded as a supplier of electricity, gas, thermal energy or water. ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS 1. Allowable Errors 1.1. Under rated operating conditions and in the absence of a disturbance, the error of measurement shall not exceed the maximum permissible error MPE value as laid down in the appropriate instrument specific requirements. Unless stated otherwise in the instrument specific annexes, MPE is expressed as a bilateral value of the deviation from the true measurement value. 1.2. Under rated operating conditions and in the presence of a disturbance, the performance requirement shall be as laid down in the appropriate instrument specific requirements. Where the instrument is intended to be used in a specified permanent continuous electromagnetic field the permitted performance during the radiated electromagnetic field amplitude modulated test shall be within MPE. EN L 96 170 Official Journal of the European Union 29.3.2014  1.3. The manufacturer shall specify the climatic, mechanical and electromagnetic environments in which the instrument is intended to be used, power supply and other influence quantities likely to affect its accuracy, taking account of the requirements laid down in the appropriate instrument specific annexes. 1.3.1.

DEFINITIONS Material measure of length An instrument comprising scale marks whose distances are given in legal units of length. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS Reference Conditions 1.1. For tapes of length equal to or greater than 5 metres, the maximum permissible errors MPEs are to be met when a tractive force of fifty newtons or other force values as specified by the manufacturer and marked on the tape accordingly, or in the case of rigid or semi rigid measures no tractive force is needed, is applied. 1.2. The reference temperature is 20 C unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer and marked on the measure accordingly. MPEs 2. The MPE, positive or negative in mm, between two non consecutive scale marks is a bL , where L is the value of the length rounded up to the next whole metre and a and b are given in Table 1 below. When a terminal interval is bounded by a surface, the MPE for any distance beginning at this point is increased by the value c given in Table 1. Table 1 Accuracy Class a mm b c mm I 0,1 0,1 0,1 II 0,3 0,2 0,2 III 0,6 0,4 0,3 D special class for dipping tapes 1 Up to and including 30 m 2 1,5 zero zero S special class for tank strapping tapes For each 30 m length when the tape is supported on a flat surface 1,5 zero zero 1 Applies to the tape dip weight combinations. 2 If the nominal tape length exceeds 30 m, an additional mpe of 0,75 mm shall be permitted for each 30 m of tape length. Dip tapes may also be of Classes I or II in which case for any length between two scale marks, one of which is on the sinker and the other on the tape, the MPE is 0,6 mm when application of the formula gives a value of less than 0,6 mm. The MPE for the length between consecutive scale marks, and the maximum permissible difference between two consecutive intervals, are given in Table 2 below.

Materials 3.1. Materials used for material measures shall be such that length variations due to temperature excursions up to 8 C about the reference temperature do not exceed the MPE. This does not apply to Class S and Class D measures where the manufacturer intends that thermal expansion corrections shall be applied to observed readings where necessary. 3.2. Measures made from material whose dimensions may alter materially when subjected to a wide range of relative humidity, may only be included in Classes II or III. Markings 4. The nominal value shall be marked on the measure. Millimetre scales shall be numbered every centimetre and measures with a scale interval greater than 2 cm shall have all scale marks numbered. CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT The conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 17 that the manufacturer can choose between are F 1 or D1 or B D or H or G. CHAPTER II Capacity serving measures The relevant essential requirements of Annex I, and the specific requirements and the conformity assessment procedures listed in this chapter, apply to capacity serving measures defined below. However, the requirement for the supply of a copy of declarations of conformity may be interpreted as applying to a batch or consignment rather than each individual instrument. Also, the requirement for the instrument to bear information in respect of its accuracy shall not apply. DEFINITIONS Capacity serving measure A capacity measure such as a drinking glass, jug or thimble measure designed to determine a specified volume of a liquid other than a pharmaceutical product which is sold for immediate consumption. Line measure A capacity serving measure marked with a line to indicate nominal capacity. Brim measure A capacity serving measure for which the internal volume is equal to the nominal capacity. Transfer measure A capacity serving measure from which it is intended that the liquid is decanted prior to consumption. Capacity The capacity is the internal volume for brim measures or internal volume to a filling mark for line measures. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS 1. Reference Conditions 1.1. Temperature the reference temperature for measurement of capacity is 20 C. 1.2. Position for correct indication free standing on a level surface.

EN L 96 240 Official Journal of the European Union 29.3.2014  ANNEX XII EXHAUST GAS ANALYSERS MI 010 The relevant requirements of Annex I, the specific requirements of this Annex and the conformity assessment procedures listed in this Annex, apply to exhaust gas analysers defined below intended for inspection and professional maintenance of motor vehicles in use. DEFINITIONS Exhaust gas analyser An exhaust gas analyser is a measuring instrument that serves to determine the volume fractions of specified components of the exhaust gas of a motor vehicle engine with spark ignition at the moisture level of the sample analysed. These gas components are carbon monoxide CO , carbon dioxide CO 2 , oxygen O 2 and hydrocarbons HC . The content of hydrocarbons has to be expressed as concentration of n hexane C 6 H 14 , measured with near infrared absorption techniques. The volume fractions of the gas components are expressed as a percentage vol for CO, CO 2 and O 2 and in parts per million ppm vol for HC. Moreover, an exhaust gas analyser calculates the lambda value from the volume fractions of the components of the exhaust gas. Lambda Lambda is a dimensionless value representative of the burning efficiency of an engine in terms of air fuel ratio in the exhaust gases. It is determined with a reference standardised formula. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS Instrument Classes 1. Two classes 0 and I are being defined for exhaust gas analysers. The relevant minimum measuring ranges for these classes are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Classes and measuring ranges Parameter Classes 0 and I CO fraction from 0 to 5 vol CO 2 fraction from 0 to 16 vol HC fraction from 0 to 2 000 ppm vol O 2 fraction from 0 to 21 vol λ from 0,8 to 1,2 Rated operating conditions 2. The values of the operating conditions shall be specified by the manufacturer as follows 2.1. For the climatic and mechanical influence quantities a minimum temperature range of 35 C for the climatic environment the mechanical environment class that applies is M1. 2.2. For the electrical power influence quantities the voltage and frequency range for the AC voltage supply the limits of the DC voltage supply. EN 29.3.2014 Official Journal of the European Union L 96 241  2.3. For the ambient pressure the minimum and the maximum values of the ambient pressure are for both classes p min 860 hPa, p max 1 060 hPa. Maximum permissible errors MPEs 3. The MPEs are defined as follows 3.1. For each of the fractions measured, the maximum error value permitted under rated operating conditions according to point 1.1 of Annex I is the greater of the two values shown in Table 2. Absolute values are expressed in vol or ppm vol, percentage values are percent of the true value. Table 2 MPEs Parameter Class 0 Class I CO fraction 0,03 vol 5 0,06 vol 5 CO 2 fraction 0,5 vol 5 0,5 vol 5 HC fraction 10 ppm vol 5 12 ppm vol 5 O 2 fraction 0,1 vol 5 0,1 vol 5 3.2. The MPE on lambda calculation is 0,3 . The conventional true value is calculated according to the formula set out in point 5.3.7.3 of Regulation No 83 of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations UN ECE 1 . For this purpose, the values displayed by the instrument are used for calculation. Permissible effect of disturbances 4. For each of the volume fractions measured by the instrument, the critical change value is equal to the MPE for the parameter concerned. 5. The effect of an electromagnetic disturbance shall be such that either the change in the measurement result is not greater than the critical change value laid down in point 4 or the presentation of the measurement result is such that it cannot be taken for a valid result. Other requirements 6. The resolution shall be equal to or of one order of magnitude higher than the values shown in Table 3. Table 3 Resolution CO CO 2 O 2 HC Class 0 and class I 0,01 vol 0,1 vol 1 1 ppm vol 1 0,01 vol for measurand values below or equal to 4 vol, otherwise 0,1 vol. The lambda value shall be displayed with a resolution of 0,001. EN L 96 242 Official Journal of the European Union 29.3.2014 1 OJ L 42, 15.2.2012, p. 1.  7. The standard deviation of 20 measurements shall not be greater than one third of the modulus of the MPE for each applicable gas volume fraction. 8. For measuring CO, CO 2 and HC, the instrument, including the specified gas handling system, must indicate 95 of the final value as determined with calibration gases within 15 seconds after changing from a gas with zero content, e.g. fresh air. For measuring O 2 , the instrument under similar conditions must indicate a value differing less than 0,1 vol from zero within 60 seconds after changing from fresh air to an oxygen free gas. 9. The components in the exhaust gas, other than the components whose values are subject to the measurement, shall not affect the measurement results by more than the half of the modulus of the MPEs when those components are present in the following maximum volume fractions 6 vol CO, 16 vol CO 2 , 10 vol O 2 , 5 vol H 2 , 0,3 vol NO, 2 000 ppm vol HC as n hexane , water vapor up to saturation. 10. An exhaust gas analyser shall have an adjustment facility that provides operations for zero setting, gas calibration and internal adjustment. The adjustment facility for zero setting and internal adjustment shall be automatic. 11. For automatic or semi automatic adjustment facilities, the instrument shall be unable to make a measurement as long as the adjustments have not been made. 12. An exhaust gas analyser shall detect hydrocarbon residues in the gas handling system. It shall not be possible to carry out a measurement if the hydrocarbon residues, present before any measurement, exceed 20 ppm vol. 13. An exhaust gas analyser shall have a device for automatically recognising any malfunctioning of the sensor of the oxygen channel due to wear or a break in the connecting line. 14. If the exhaust gas analyser is capable to operate with different fuels e.g. petrol or liquefied gas , there shall be the possibility to select the suitable coefficients for the Lambda calculation without ambiguity concerning the appropriate formula.
