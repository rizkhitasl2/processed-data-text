Over the past 12 months, the department has made significant progress towards delivering the government s vision for Australia s future prosperity and productivity. We have provided targeted investment and further developed policies and regulatory settings with a particular focus on the global energy transition in our commitment to building a better future for all Australians. The creation of the National Reconstruction Fund is a significant government reform that will diversify and transform Australia s industry and economy through targeted investments across priority areas. The department also consulted on the design of the Industry Growth Program, which aims to advance Australia s industrial capability by supporting small and medium sized enterprises to commercialise their ideas and grow their businesses. We are supporting industry to seize opportunities emerging from Australia s transition to net zero by 2050. We consulted on the National Battery Strategy and the establishment of the Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre to grow Australia s renewable technologies industry. Work across industry sectors continues with the establishment of the Office of National Rail Industry Coordination and the National Rail Industry Innovation Council. The National Rail Manufacturing Advocate was appointed to develop and implement the National Rail Procurement and Manufacturing Strategy in consultation with industry and states and territories. The Australian Building Codes Board delivered major reforms in residential energy efficiency and liveable housing design through the 2022 edition of the National Construction Code. The department also consulted extensively on seafood country of origin labelling, including on a proposal to amend the Australian Consumer Law to introduce mandatory country of origin labelling for seafood in hospitality settings.  Annual report 2022 23 3 Chapter 1 Overview To boost supply chain resilience, we supported the new Indo Pacific Economic Framework Supply Chains Agreement. The agreement, the development of which benefited from broad ranging industry stakeholder engagement, establishes a platform for working with industry to better integrate our manufacturers and exporters in the region s supply chains. These new activities are complemented by established initiatives that empower businesses to innovate and grow. During 2022 23, the Research and Development  R D Tax Incentive encouraged more than 12,000 businesses to invest over 15 billion in cutting edge R D. The department also provided 922.4 million in grant payments to 2,970 businesses through our programs, as well as on behalf of other agencies. December 2022, marked the 20th anniversary of the Venture Capital Act 2002, which plays a critical role in building a mature Australian venture capital ecosystem. Over the lifetime of the Act, 254 registered partnerships have invested 10.4 billion of domestic and foreign capital in innovative early stage and expanding businesses. In 2022 23 alone, 1.56 billion was invested in 500 businesses. Nearly half of this year s investments have been in digital and healthcare businesses, with investments growing in synthetic biology and quantum. The Single Business Service via the business.gov.au website provides a trusted entry point for Australian businesses to access information, grants, services and support from across government. In 2022 23, the Single Business Service recorded 7.5 million web sessions, around 145,000 contacts and 195,138 e newsletter and social media followers. Support for Australia s scientific and technological capabilities is essential to national prosperity and a more inclusive, diverse and fair Australia. During 2022 23, we began work on revitalising Australia s National Science and Research Priorities and National Science Statement, and the independent Pathway to Diversity in STEM Review. We also nurtured the future of Australian science with a range of programs, including Elevate, which provides up to 500 undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships in STEM to women and non binary people. National Science Week 2022 delivered more than 1,000 events across the country, with the Inspiring Australia program supporting 33 events. In May 2023, the Australian Space Agency reached an in principle agreement with the United States of America USA on a technology safeguards agreement that will permit USA space technology to be launched from Australia. Increased USA investment in Australia s space industry will create high skill jobs in the launch sector across the country. In line with our commitment to increasing diversity in emerging industries, we also launched the National Indigenous Space Academy to create opportunities for Australia s First Nations university students. On 10 September 2022, following 6 years of negotiations, the Wajarri Yamaji community unanimously endorsed the Wajarri Yamaji Aboriginal Corporation to enter into an Indigenous land use agreement consenting to the construction of the Square Kilometre Array and other radio astronomy projects on their land.  4 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 1 Overview The government continued to build science capabilities locally and in the region through commitments like the recently announced 10.3 million investment over 6 years for the new Asia Pacific regional office of the International Science Council in Australia and delivery of the Global Science and Technology Diplomacy Fund. Australian businesses are also enhancing their capability to leverage opportunities in Asia through the government s commitment of 14.9 million over 4 years for the National Centre for Asia Capability Asialink Business . In 2022 23, the government released the National Quantum Strategy1, the List of Critical Technologies in the National Interest and the Critical Technologies Statement. The department also consulted on the National Robotics Strategy. These strategies set out a long term vision for how Australia will take advantage of opportunities in various technologies. Artificial intelligence AI presents opportunities to grow our economy, create jobs and improve our lives, but it also has inherent risks. With the launch of generative AI platforms in 2022 23, our consultation on the safe and responsible use of AI technologies is timely. Work has also continued across government, with the department partnering with the Digital Transformation Agency to release interim guidance on the use of generative AI platforms to all Australian Government agencies. In the 12 months to May 2023, Australia s technology workforce grew by 7 , reaching just over 940,000 as the nation tracks toward the government s target of 1.2 million tech related jobs by 2030. To support this goal, we established the Digital and Tech Skills Working Group under the Digital and Tech Skills Compact, meeting our commitments from the 2022 Jobs and Skills Summit. In 2022 23, the government invested in infrastructure upgrades at Questacon to ensure Australia s national science and technology centre can continue to inspire an appreciation for science and technology in the next generation of Australians. We also supported Australia s world class portfolio agencies to drive scientific endeavour and research in essential fields such as nuclear medicine, and to adapt technologies and conduct research so that Australia can succeed in the global economy. On 29 March 2023, the Resources Statement to Parliament articulated the government s commitment to strengthening the resources sector and its critical role in the pathway to net zero. The department s Resources and energy quarterly and Resources and energy major projects2 publications highlight the importance of the resources sector to Australia both now and into the future. These contain forecasts for the value, volume and price of Australia s major resources and energy commodity exports, as well as an annual review of major resources and energy projects in Australia. On 20 June 2023, the Critical Minerals Strategy 2023 20303 was launched, setting out the government s vision to grow Australia s critical minerals sector in coming years. The government allocated 23.4 million to the Critical Minerals Office, which will play a vital role in implementing the strategy and coordinating Australia s international partnership efforts. 1 2 3  Annual report 2022 23 5 Chapter 1 Overview The importance of strong international ties was recognised in the announced funding for the Critical Minerals International Partnerships Program, as well as our continued work through the Australia India Critical Minerals Investment Partnership. In 2022 23, the government built on this by announcing new partnerships with Japan, the United Kingdom and Germany, and by joining forces with the USA to establish a ministerial level taskforce. The taskforce will enhance bilateral cooperation with the USA under the Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact. To support greater flexibility when responding to domestic gas supply shortfalls, the department consulted on reforms to the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism guidelines. These reforms have now commenced. Additionally, the government signed a new Heads of Agreement with east coast liquefied natural gas exporters to prevent gas supply shortfalls and secure competitively priced gas for Australia. We also commenced work on the Future Gas Strategy, which will analyse future gas supply and demand to generate greater confidence in the market. We contributed to the effective functioning of the east coast gas market by supporting the development of a mandatory code of conduct. This will ensure that east coast gas users can contract for gas at reasonable prices and on reasonable terms. The government introduced the code on 11 July 2023. Strong progress has also been made in encouraging proactive planning for the safe and environmentally sustainable decommissioning of offshore oil and gas projects. Phase 1 of the decommissioning of the Northern Endeavour facility is well underway. Ongoing funding for the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency ARWA was also announced in the 2023 24 Budget. The work of ARWA will ensure a suitable site is located for the long term management of the Commonwealth s radioactive waste, the majority of which comes from the production of nuclear medicine. During 2022 23, we honoured longstanding government commitments, continuing to rehabilitate the Ranger and Rum Jungle uranium mine sites, and the former atomic weapons testing area at Maralinga. Our work supports environmentally safe and secure land management, and enables Traditional Owners and local communities to realise economic, social and environmental benefits. Our people are the foundation to our department s success and striving for excellence rests on our inclusiveness and diversity. I am proud of our Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan 2023 2026, which continues our efforts to advance reconciliation. In 2022 23, we increased First Nations representation in our senior executive cohort from 1 to 3 . The department s work throughout 2022 23 has strengthened our capability to deliver on our priorities for the Australian community. I look forward to progressing this work during 2023 24.  Chapter 1 Overview Highlights The following highlights represent a sample of our achievements to deliver on our purpose statement over the past 12 months. The National Reconstruction Fund growing Australia s industrial base and the economy There are significant opportunities for Australia as the domestic and global economy evolves. To capture new markets and create secure, well paying jobs, Australian industry must grow and transform. The government s commitment to establish the 15 billion National Reconstruction Fund NRF is one of the largest investments in Australian manufacturing capability. The NRF will support increased flows of finance into 7 priority areas4 of the Australian economy through targeted investment to diversify and transform Australian industry. The design and implementation of the NRF has been informed by findings from extensive consultation the department undertook in 2022 23, including engaging nationally with more than 430 organisations and individuals through roundtables and one on one meetings undertaking more than 48 virtual consultations reviewing over 250 written submissions. The department supported the development of the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Act 2023, which passed through both houses of parliament in March 2023 and received royal assent on 11 April 2023. 4 Renewables and low emission technologies, medical science, transport, value add in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, value add in resources, defence capability, and enabling capabilities.  Annual report 2022 23 7 Chapter 1 Overview Creating an end to end Australian battery industry As the world moves to net zero emissions, batteries will become a bigger part of our energy mix. Batteries will power electric vehicles, residential and community scale energy storage, and grid energy storage for small and large systems. Australia can capture parts of these growing markets, building on our strengths in mining and natural deposits of a range of battery minerals. In line with this, we have been working to deliver the government s Australian Made Battery Plan to kickstart battery manufacturing in Australia. Measures under the plan include developing a National Battery Strategy to provide a comprehensive plan for a globally competitive, end to end Australian battery industry that builds on Australia s strong innovation record and resource potential. The strategy will signal to international partners that Australia is open for investment and ready to play a role in diversifying global supply chains. As part of our collaborative approach to developing the strategy, we released an issues paper for public consultation in February 2023. implementing the 14.8 million Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre PAIGC Program that will establish the PAIGC to provide advanced technology and skills development to businesses looking to locally manufacture renewable energy technologies, including batteries. The PAIGC competitive grant application opportunity closed on 19 June 2023. partnering with the Queensland Government to establish the Australian Made Battery Precinct. We are working with the Queensland Government to provide up to 100 million in Commonwealth equity to establish the precinct. It will bring together industry, academia and the community to bolster Australia s manufacturing capability and support industry growth. Together these measures will drive productivity improvements in industry and create more jobs and greater wealth for the nation.  8 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 1 Overview Unlocking opportunities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics Skills and experience in science, technology, engineering and mathematics STEM continue to grow in importance for Australians whether people are looking to tap into the jobs market of the future or to navigate other societal changes driven by technology. To address this, we have delivered activities to strengthen community engagement with STEM. In 2022 23, we focused on increasing diversity in STEM education and careers The independent Pathway to Diversity in STEM Review, chaired by Sally Ann Williams, is looking into what is working, what is not, and what needs to be done to improve overall diversity in STEM, STEM leadership, and the STEM skilled workforce. To ensure more people were heard during the consultation process, we translated consultation materials into 5 languages and accepted submissions in a range of formats, including videos and voice recordings. We continued to deliver on our commitments to diversity in STEM. As part of this, we finalised a round of the Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship Grants program, awarding 15.9 million for 17 projects to support more women to study and build careers in STEM. We also worked with the Women in STEM Ambassador on research to support the review.  Annual report 2022 23 9 Chapter 1 Overview We delivered the third annual STEM Equity Monitor,5 which shows that while the number of women in STEM qualified occupations is rising, they still only account for 15 of these roles. In March 2023, Katherine Bennell Pegg was announced as the first person to be trained as an astronaut under the Australian flag. This opportunity will inspire more Australians to pursue STEM related careers. We also delivered activities to engage the broader community and celebrate the excellent science work undertaken in Australia On 21 November 2022, Australia s science, innovation and education community came together at Parliament House, for the first time since 2019, celebrating the Prime Minister s Prizes for Science and Science Teaching. Twelve of Australia s leading scientists, innovators and teachers were recognised for their outstanding contributions to Australian society. In August 2022, Australia celebrated National Science Week with more than 1,000 events held in universities, schools, research institutions, libraries, museums, science centres and community organisations. We provided 500,000 in funding to 35 projects through the national grant round. In June 2023, we supported the inaugural National Youth STEM Summit, which was delivered by the National Youth Science Forum. It brought together young STEM talent from around Australia to share ideas, explore STEM careers and meet science and technology leaders. Questacon, the national science and technology centre, supports the community to engage in science, including helping young people to develop the attributes, skills, knowledge and agency to thrive in tomorrow s world. In 2022 23, Questacon held activities across Australia and in Canberra, including the 2022 Governor General s Design Challenge as part of Questacon s Science Week events. Live broadcasts of science activity workshops were delivered to a local school and then as a national live broadcast that reached 6,850 students from 140 school from across Australia helped both students and teachers develop cyber skills under its cyber program, and delivered 166 cyber student workshops to 50 schools ran a program of travelling exhibitions which were reached by 187,980 visitors nationally hosted the 2023 Mid Winter Nights which brought 3,248 visitors to its Canberra centre for a unique, family friendly after hours experience. It included the usual offerings along with hot and cold themed science activities, demonstrations, shows and catering options engaged children in the vital early years with Science Time. During 2022 23, more than 1,076 children aged between 3 and 5 participated in the program to encourage a life long interest in STEM. These efforts are helping to boost the pipeline of new STEM talent pipeline and build long term science and technology capabilities to solve challenges and improve Australian productivity and wellbeing. 5  Chapter 1 Overview Charting Australia s quantum future The Minister for Industry and Science, the Hon Ed Husic MP, outlined the government s commitment to quantum technologies and building a sustainable, world leading quantum economy with the launch of Australia s first National Quantum Strategy6 on 3 May 2023. Australia s Chief Scientist, Dr Cathy Foley AO PSM, led the effort to develop the strategy, guided by the National Quantum Advisory Committee. The strategy provides a national vision for growing the quantum sector over the next 7 years. It details actions the government will take to create a thriving environment for developing and adopting quantum technologies secure access to essential infrastructure and materials build the future quantum workforce create standards and frameworks that support national interests grow a trusted, ethical and inclusive quantum ecosystem. Early priorities include establishing the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth 19.8 million to foster demand for quantum technologies and launching the Critical Technologies Challenge Program 40.2 million to support collaborative research and development projects that apply quantum and other critical technologies to challenges of national significance. 6  Annual report 2022 23 11 Chapter 1 Overview The Critical Minerals Strategy The Critical Minerals Strategy 2023 2030,7 released on 17 June 2023 by the Hon Madeleine King MP, Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia, sets out an ambitious vision to grow the geostrategic and economic footprint of Australia s critical minerals sector by becoming a globally significant producer of raw and processed critical minerals. Critical minerals support industries and technologies that are crucial for the global transition to net zero emissions, domestic and regional security, and our defence and economic security. The strategy provides a policy framework to guide future decisions for government to maximise the national benefits from Australia s significant critical minerals endowments. Focus areas have been identified for further actions to grow the sector and ensure Australia remains competitive in the rapidly evolving global market. To shape the strategy, the Critical Minerals Office conducted roundtables and one on one meetings with representatives from industry, academia, First Nations groups, community groups and state and territory governments. It received more than 130 written submissions in response to the consultation. Following the strategy s release, the department has begun work with industry, scientific experts and international partners to facilitate investment in the sector, collaborate on research and development, and shape emerging market rules and norms. Consultation has also begun to update Australia s Critical Minerals List based on global technology needs, particularly for emissions reduction, advanced manufacturing and defence. 7  12 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 1 Overview Chapter One Overview Reforming the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism Australia is one of the biggest exporters of natural gas in the world. The Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism ADGSM , which originally came into effect on 1 July 2017, ensures there is sufficient natural gas supply to meet the needs of Australian energy users. It allows the Minister for Resources to restrict the export of liquefied natural gas LNG to prevent a supply shortage in the domestic gas market. In August 2022, amid ongoing gas market volatility, the Minister for Resources announced that the ADGSM had been formally extended to 2030, ensuring the government retained a mechanism to safeguard domestic gas supplies. The government consulted extensively with industry, stakeholders, export partners and the public on reforms to the ADGSM to improve the mechanism and enable it to be used at short notice in the event of a forecast gas shortfall. The reforms were announced in October 2022 and their implementation brought forward from 1 July to 1 April 2023. In early 2023, the department sought feedback on the design and operational effectiveness of the ADGSM, leading to the publication of guidelines on 30 March 2023. The ADGSM reforms allow the Minister for Resources to consider whether to activate the ADGSM quarterly ahead of peak seasonal demands require LNG exporters to share equal responsibility for preventing a shortfall introduce measures to protect long term international contracts that underpin investments in Australia s gas industry allow export permits to be traded to improve the ADGSM s economic efficiency.  Annual report 2022 23 13 Chapter 1 Overview The reformed ADGSM provides the government more flexibility to respond to domestic gas supply shortfalls while maintaining Australia s commitment to remaining a reliable trade and investment partner. The ADGSM remains a measure of last resort, only to be used if market based solutions and other regulatory interventions fail to provide sufficient gas to Australian consumers. To further safeguard Australia s domestic supplies, the government established a Heads of Agreement with east coast LNG gas exporters. Its objective is to prevent a gas supply shortfall through access to secure and competitively priced gas for the east coast domestic market. Under the agreement, east coast LNG exporters have committed to supply competitively priced gas to Australian users. The Minister for Resources and east coast LNG exporters signed the Heads of Agreement on 29 September 2022, and it is in place until 1 January 2026. To improve the functioning of the east coast gas market, the government introduced a mandatory code of conduct to ensure that east coast gas users can contract for gas at reasonable prices and on reasonable terms. The code came into effect on 11 July 2023.  14 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 1 Overview Portfolio overview Ministers The responsible ministers on 30 June 2023 were the Hon Madeleine King MP, Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia the Hon Ed Husic MP, Minister for Industry and Science Senator the Hon Tim Ayres, Assistant Minister for Manufacturing and Assistant Minister for Trade.

Output measures assess the quantity and quality of the goods and services produced by an activity including their volume or quantity . Efficiency measures are generally expressed as a ratio of inputs to outputs, where efficiency involves maximising outputs for a given volume of inputs. The timely delivery of an output is commonly used as a proxy for efficiency. Effectiveness measures assess how well the department has delivered on its purposes, and where activities have had the intended impact or contributed to achieving the purposes. Of the 16 performance measures reported on 13 were met 1 was partially met 2 measures had their baseline set.

It relates to PBS 2022 23 Outcome 1, Program 1.2. 1 Business co investment through portfolio initiative funding Target 2021 22 result 2022 23 result Maintain an average of at least 1.20 of business co investment for every 1 of grant funding for portfolio programs that require business co investment New measure in 2022 23 2.83 for every 1.00 of grant funding 2022 23 assessment Met Analysis of result Business co investment in programs demonstrates commitment to growing innovative and competitive businesses across targeted industries. It provides evidence of business commitment to delivering on the project or activity. Including a co investment requirement in programs supports building a resilient, and dynamic economic base. This will support Australian industry to better adapt to new markets and leverage emerging opportunities, thereby creating jobs and benefiting the broader economy. The departmental programs with contracts in scope for the reporting period are listed at Table 3.  26 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance Table 3 Program specific co investment requirements Program name Program specific co investment requirement for every dollar of grant funding Dollars co invested for every 1 of grant funding achieved Critical Minerals Accelerator Initiative 1.00 1.50 Critical Minerals Development Program 1.00 2.10 Cyber Security Skills Partnership Innovation Fund Round 2 1.00 1.50 Entrepreneurs Programme Accelerating Commercialisation Grant 1.00 1.05 Entrepreneurs Programme Growth Grant 1.00 1.00 Innovation Connections Grant 1.00 1.19 Maker Projects Community STEM Engagement grants 2022 0.25 0.81 Manufacturing Integration Stream Round 2 1.00 1.96 Manufacturing Translation Stream Round 2 1.00 2.61 Modern Manufacturing Initiative Manufacturing Collaboration Stream 2.00 4.45 Moon to Mars Initiative Demonstrator Mission 0.33 0.37 Moon to Mars Initiative Trailblazer Stage 1 0.3310 0.76 Supply Chain Resilience Initiative Round 2 1.00 1.56 Cooperative Research Centres Grants 1.00 2.84 Cooperative Research Centres Projects 1.00 1.85 10 Requirement is a minimum co contribution of 1 million for a maximum grant amount of 4 million.  Annual report 2022 23 27 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance A high co investment amount indicates the private sector is willing to spend money on projects that are in line with the policy intent of programs. Driving the result for the 2022 23 financial year was a strong co contribution from the manufacturing sector and the critical minerals sector through the Modern Manufacturing Initiative programs and the Critical Minerals Development Program willingness by a broad range of businesses and researchers to participate in the Cooperative Research Centres Program, leading to a high number of partners and more contributions. Programs with a lower co investment result were due to targeting emergent industries, such as in the Moon to Mars Initiative targeting community organisations, such as in the Maker Projects. The overall high result indicates that portfolio funding is well targeted, as funding has gone to competitive organisations that are willing to make significant private sector investment. Limitations Data provided as part of this measure is based on the contracted business contribution and grant amount for contracts in scope for the reporting period. Actual co contributions cannot be determined until progress or final reporting, which often occurs outside the reporting period. It is unlikely to vary significantly from the contracted funding ratio. However, this is monitored over the life of these programs to ensure grantees are meeting their contractual requirements.  28 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance 2 Proportion of grants and services delivered to regional businesses Target 2021 22 result 2022 23 result 25 or more total grants or services delivered to regional businesses 28 32 2022 23 assessment Met Analysis of result The department strives to ensure equitable access to business support regardless of geographical areas. This is achieved by designing grant opportunities that target a range of sectors across Australia spanning both metropolitan and regional areas. Further support is provided through AusIndustry Business Outreach, which operates a network of 30 regional managers across the country who are connected to regions, communities and industries. Regional managers help local business identify government support mechanisms that enable growth opportunities. Our programs are designed to support businesses across our economy. To ensure regional businesses receive appropriate support we aim for at least 25 of grants and services to be delivered to businesses in the regions. For grants and services delivered in 2022 23, 32.3 were delivered to businesses with a regional address, and 67.6 were delivered to businesses with an address in a major city. Only 0.1 were delivered to businesses that were outside the scope of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard ASGS Remoteness Structure.11 Limitations Data used in this measure is based on the address of the business, and the delivery of the grant or service may occur at a different project location. 11 The ASGS Remoteness Structure defines remoteness areas for the purpose of releasing and analysing statistics. Remoteness areas are derived from the Accessibility Remoteness Index of Australia Plus ARIA produced by the University of Adelaide. Remoteness areas divide Australia into 5 classes of remoteness on the basis of a measure of relative access to services. They are major cities, inner regional, outer regional, remote and very remote. For more information, refer to statistical geography standard asgs edition 3 jul2021 jun2026 remoteness structure.  Annual report 2022 23 29 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance 3 Applicant satisfaction with the experience of the grants application process through the business.gov.au portal Target 2021 22 result 2022 23 result Baseline to be set in 2022 23 New measure in 2022 23 Baseline set 90 2022 23 assessment Baseline set Analysis of result The department operates the Business Grants Hub, which provides grants to businesses and other organisations across Australia. This service is provided on behalf of the department and 11 other Commonwealth agencies. In 2022 23, the Business Grants Hub executed more than 4,900 grant contracts across 116 grant programs, valued at over 1.94 billion. These grants help to achieve the government s policy objectives for the benefit of all Australians. An effective grant application process helps businesses engage with government and effectively access the support provided. By measuring satisfaction with the application process at the end of the application form, the department can collect feedback from a broad range of applicants who interact with government, including those who are later deemed unsuccessful for funding. We have used 2022 23 to set a baseline to inform the target for future years. Before a question on satisfaction was built into the grant application, applicant satisfaction results were collected via survey. A total of 2,806 responses were recorded through both the survey and application forms 88 of respondents reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the grant application process 9 of respondents were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied 3 of respondents were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied.  30 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance Table 4 Satisfaction levels by response type Satisfaction level Survey responses Application form responses Satisfied or very satisfied 289 73 2,176 90 Neither satisfied or dissatisfied 51 13 198 8 Dissatisfied or very dissatisfied 56 14 36 1 Total number of responses 396 2,410 Just over 90 of applicants surveyed through the application form were satisfied or very satisfied with the grant application process compared with 88 of all respondents and this has been used to set the baseline. We use customer feedback to inform continuous improvement of the grant application experience across our systems and processes. For example, based on user feedback, we are improving the user experience of completing budget information within the application form. This means policy agencies can be confident their programs are being accessed with user experience in mind. Limitations Before a question on satisfaction was built into the grant application, applicant satisfaction was assessed via a survey. Two methodologies were used to collect data for 2022 23. Fourteen per cent of total responses were collected through a survey and 86 were collected through the grant application. Each method had limitations Survey responses were optional. The sample was limited to grant applicants who chose to participate. Responses were collected for the period 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 and the response rate was 16 . As applicants were surveyed after being notified of the outcome of their application, their response may have been influenced by the success of their application. Application responses were compulsory from 9 January 2023 through to 30 June 2023. While the application form stated the satisfaction question would not affect the assessment process, applicants may have believed a positive response would result in a more favourable assessment of their application. The wording was slightly different across the 2 methods. Survey applicants were asked, How satisfied were you with the overall experience of applying for a grant through the portal Through the application form, applicants were asked, How satisfied were you with the process of applying for this grant Differences in question wording may have influenced applicants responses. From 2023 24 onwards only the application form response will be collected, which will eliminate this discrepancy.  Annual report 2022 23 31 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance 4 Effective regulation to assure the safety and security of space activities Target 2021 22 result12 2022 23 result13 Zero 14 fatalities serious injuries damage to other property across the number of authorised space activities. Nil Nil Nil 7 authorised space activities Nil Nil Nil 5 authorised space activities 2022 23 assessment Met Analysis of result Space capability contributes to Australia s economic prosperity, national security and management of challenges such as climate change. The space sector provides critical data for sectors such as resources, agriculture and environment, as well as access to new markets and high skilled jobs. It diversifies and advances our manufacturing base, and unlocks emerging technologies in communications, remote operations, robotics and automation. The Space Launches and Returns Act 2018 is administered by the department through the Australian Space Agency. It aims to achieve a reasonable balance between removing barriers to participation in space activities and encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation in the space industry. The agency also oversees the safety of space activities, and the risk of damage to persons or property. This measure aims to provide a quantitative assessment of the agency s effectiveness in achieving this balance. The measure is contextualised by the level of space activity, represented by the volume of authorisations made by the agency, as part of its regulatory role, over the reporting period. Any fatality, serious injury or damage to other property as a result of a space activity conducted in 2022 23, but notified outside of the reporting period, will be captured in the subsequent reporting period. Limitations The Space Launches and Returns Act 2018 applies only to certain upstream activities in the space sector value chain typically involving space launch. As such, it provides an indicator of activity in the manufacturing and launch segments of the Australian space sector, but does not measure broader Australian space activity. 12 The 2021 22 result has been calculated retrospectively to reflect the 2022 23 performance measure and target rather than the 2021 22 performance measure, which was to develop and implement flexible approaches in the regulation of Australia s space activities, with a target of year on year improvement. 13 about space activities. 14 The Space Launches and Returns Act 2018 has terms consistent with the terms zero fatalities , serious injuries and damage to other property as a result of authorised Australian space activities.  32 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance 5 Proportion of major projects that are compliant with their approved Australian Industry Participation AIP plans Target 2021 22 result 2022 23 result 100 100 100 2022 23 assessment Met Analysis of result The main objective of the Australian Jobs Act 2013 is to support the creation and retention of Australian jobs. The Act requires proponents of eligible productive facilities with capital expenditure of 500 million or more to prepare and implement an AIP plan. AIP plans ensure that Australian entities have the opportunity to tender to supply key goods or services through all stages of a project, and get assistance with capability development and integration into global supply chains. This objective is in line with the department s priority to grow competitive Australian industries and jobs, and to secure reliable supply chains. The AIP Authority assesses projects 6 monthly compliance reports and supporting evidence to ensure proponents are complying with their AIP plans and not relying solely on their existing supply chains. The AIP Authority received 167 compliance reports from 95 major projects in 2022 23. The reports were assessed by the AIP Authority with all projects demonstrating compliance with their approved AIP plans, either at submission or after feedback from the AIP Authority and subsequent amendments to the reports. Compliance was verified through major projects providing evidence in their reporting. Over 2022 23, the AIP Authority actively worked with proponents to achieve compliance and did not detect any compliance breaches requiring use of legislative sanctions. To help proponents to understand and meet the compliance obligations in their AIP plans, the AIP Authority focused on education. This included developing a best practice user guide and providing feedback on proponents reports. The feedback assisted new proponents who were unfamiliar with the reporting process and experienced proponents who needed further information and clarification. It also helped in instances where there had been changes to the project, including key personnel.  Annual report 2022 23 33 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance 6 Applications for registration of research and development activities through the Research and Development Tax Incentive R DTI are processed within designated timeframes Target 2021 22 result15 2022 23 result 95 of applications processed within 40 business days for first time registrants 20 business days for registrants that have applied within 6 months after the end of the income period 80 business days for registrations submitted from 6 to 10 months after the end of the income period. 99 99 100 100 99 100 2022 23 assessment Met Analysis of result The R DTI program offers a tax offset to companies conducting eligible Research and Development R D activities. This encourages additional R D investment, which generates wider benefits for the Australian economy. As at 30 June 2023, for registrations occurring in the 2021 22 financial year more than 12,700 companies were registered for the R DTI program total R D expenditure was 15.3 billion. This measure quantifies the number of business days that elapse between the 2 critical administration points of when a company applies to the R DTI program, and when that company is registered in the program by the department. While a standard benchmark of 95 is applied for this measure, different processing timeframes allotted to each of the 3 cohorts reflect variations in processing time to register companies under certain conditions. 15 The 2021 22 target was the same as the 2022 23 target. However, the 2021 22 result has been re calculated to exclude weekends, in line with the 2022 23 result assessment.  34 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance The improvement in the 2022 23 results, relative to 2021 22 results, may be attributable to the temporary reallocation of staff from other areas in the branch to work on processing registrations during the registration peak period and the use of more streamlined administrative processes. Specifically, the processing target for first time registrant companies is 40 business days. This allows adequate checks to be performed for companies applying to the program for the first time returning registrant companies is 20 business days if they are applying within 6 months after the end of the income period this typically occurs outside peak processing periods returning registrant companies is 80 business days if they are applying within 6 to 10 months after the end of the income period. This 6 to 10 month interval is a peak processing period and the extended target is applied to account for this peak. R D activities must be registered before an R D tax offset is claimed through a company s tax return. Timely registration of an R D tax offset benefits companies because they can then lodge their tax returns and receive the tax offset benefit. Limitations The 2022 23 results of this performance measure report processing timeframes for R D tax incentive applications from the 2021 22 financial year, as companies can apply to register their R D activities up to 10 months after the end of each financial year.

The number of technology related jobs in May 2023 was 940,600 which represents a 6.9 increase from May 2022, when the total number was 879,800  6.6  of total employment .  36 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance The increase in the number of technology related jobs is due to a range of economic factors, supported by several government actions. The department leads a range of sectoral strategies, consultations and initiatives that help to mature Australia s technology adoption readiness and highlight the role that technology related jobs have in improving productivity. Examples include Research and Development Tax Incentive supports business to invest and grow through R D, including R D in relation to technological development Initiatives to support the safe and responsible use of artificial intelligence AI ,16 building on the existing AI ethics framework17 the department is also implementing a new responsible AI adopt program and is leading a broader public discussion focussed on ensuring Australia has the right governance mechanisms in place in relation to AI National Quantum Strategy18 promotes Australia as the world s top destination for people studying, undertaking research in, and working in quantum industries National Robotics Strategy19 public consultation to inform the strategy is seeking to understand future workforce requirements, including our existing strengths and any gaps that need to be addressed Critical Technologies Hub20 advises the government on critical technology opportunities, developments and risks.

An essential element of the Australian workforce meeting the demand for technology related jobs is skills development. We contribute to this through targeted programs and our work with the agencies that have the key levers for skills development. Skills focused work being led by the department include next generation AI and emerging technology programs, which are expected to attract and train up to 480 job ready graduates in AI and other emerging technologies support to up to 20 PhDs under the Australian Quantum Graduates Program initiatives to support greater participation of women in STEM and the ongoing Pathway to Diversity in STEM Review. The department works across government to support processes and a more coordinated approach to meeting Australia s technology related jobs challenge. This work includes convening a regular Commonwealth digital skill working group to support engagement and discussion on cross cutting issues relating to tech skills partnering with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations on taking forward the Digital and Tech Skills Compact, a commitment made at the Jobs and Skills Summit by the government to work with industry, unions and education and training providers to meet Australia s tech related skills challenge. A working group established under the compact is finalising its report on a model digital apprenticeship scheme contributing to broader government reform initiatives including the Review of the Migration System, the Employment White Paper and the Australian Universities Accord.  38 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance 15 Anti Dumping Commission compliance with legislated and World Trade Organization WTO timeframes is maintained or improved Target 2021 22 result 2022 23 result Baseline to be set in 2022 23 New measure in 2022 23 Baseline set refer to Tables 5 and 6 in analysis of result 2022 23 assessment Baseline set Analysis of result In administering an anti dumping system, the department seeks to support Australian industry and the economy by remedying proven instances of unfair international trade. It does this through the Anti Dumping Commission investigating Australian industries claims of dumping and subsidisation of imported goods seeking and considering evidence from Australian producers and importers, as well as foreign exporters making recommendations to the responsible minister on the imposition, continuation, withdrawal or adjustment of dumping and countervailing duties. The Anti Dumping Commission operates in accordance with best practice regulation principles to administer a transparent and accessible system that affords due process to all interested parties publishes evidentiary, analytical and process related material promptly meets predictable maximum timeframes.  This is a new performance measure and 2022 23 results established a baseline for future years. Noting the complexity in building a robust and meaningful performance story, the focus in the first year of reporting is to demonstrate that the Anti Dumping Commission satisfied its international legal obligations and met strict and extended domestic legislative timeframes for completing cases across all case types. Case types are set out in the Customs Act 1901 Customs Tariff Anti Dumping Act 1975. Table 5 provides a summary of the cases completed by case type during 2022 23, the average time taken to complete, the statutory timeframes and a comparison against WTO timeframes, where appropriate.

Received refers to the original lodgement date of an application. For reinvestigations, received refers to the date a request is submitted by the Anti Dumping Review Panel. Most case types require the Commissioner to reject or not reject an application within 20 days of lodgement exemptions and reinvestigations have no legislative requirement . If the Commissioner is not satisfied that the application meets the relevant requirements of the particular case type then he must reject the application and notify the applicant. Once an application is rejected and the applicant notified then the case is completed . An application may be withdrawn by the applicant in writing at any time during the process either prior to initiation or after initiation. Cases withdrawn are considered  completed . Where the Commissioner decides not to reject an application, a notice to initiate must be published on the website. For investigations, anti circumvention inquiries, review of measures and continuation inquiries case types, the statutory requirements for publishing a statement of essential facts and providing the final report to the Minister commence from the publication date of the initiation notice for example, final report is to be provided to the Minister 155 days from initiation, however this date can be extended . Duty assessments, accelerated reviews, exemption inquiries and reinvestigation case types have no requirement to be initiated by notice on our website. However, if they are not rejected, they are regarded as being initiated on the date received. A case is regarded as completed when withdrawn, rejected, terminated or upon publication of notice of findings.  Annual report 2022 23 41 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance For further context regarding the volume and length of extensions, Table 7 shows the extensions for 2022 23 by case type.

Limitations As a demand driven investigative system, working to both strict and extendable legislative deadlines, the Anti Dumping Commission has limited ability to control timeframes. A range of factors directly and indirectly affect timeframes across all case types including requirements to meet strict legislative timeframes in new cases or reinvestigate previous cases following a merits review the level and timeliness of interested parties engagement the need to appropriately sequence decisions on related cases. To reflect this, the contextual data on volume of cases, by case type, as well as other relevant contextual data, will be subject to comparative, year on year analysis in future reporting periods.  42 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance Key activity 1.2 investing in science and technology This activity aims to boost our science and technology capability to facilitate the development and uptake of new ideas and technology and build a strong base for science to be used in Australian decision making.

To support this the department delivers initiatives, such as grant programs, to support business research collaborations. This supports the business community. The Cooperative Research Centres CRC Program both CRCs and CRC Projects provides grant funding to support industry led partnerships working on industry identified problems to improve Australian industry competitiveness, productivity and sustainability. The total number of business and research organisations active in CRCs and CRC Projects for the 2022 23 reporting period was 1,921 1,412 in CRCs and 509 in CRC Projects . This is an overall increase of 9.3 from the equivalent reporting period in 2021 22 1,758 . The Entrepreneurs Programme Innovation Connections service provided participants with advice and funding to get research projects underway. This included connecting Australian small and medium sized enterprises with research institutions and helping them apply for grants to fund research projects. The total number of business and research organisations supported by the Innovation Connections service for the 2022 23 reporting period was 307, on par with the equivalent 2021 22 reporting period, which supported 312. The 2022 23 result both for the overall performance measure and the CRC Program increased primarily due to the addition of successful Round 23 CRCs to the pool of active CRCs contributing to the performance measure, with all CRCs from the previous year 2021 22 continuing to operate in 2022 23. 25 The 2021 22 target was a year on year increase. 26 The 2021 22 result was recalculated using current contributing programs, noting the performance measure for 2021 22 was number of business research collaborations facilitated by portfolio programs , with a year on year increase target.  Annual report 2022 23 43 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance Limitations Contributing programs may be amended year to year. For 2022 23, the performance measure and contributing programs shifted from business research collaborations in 2021 22 to research focused collaborations. 9 Raising awareness of the importance of STEM through the delivery of portfolio initiatives Target 2020 21 result 2021 22 result 2022 23 result Proportion of Australians who consider STEM skills important when considering employment Parents 87 Educators 87 Young Australians 87 86 89 Not conducted Not conducted Not conducted 92 81 89 Not conducted 2022 23 assessment Partially met Analysis of result The government s investment in science and technology is focused on building Australia s capability and engagement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics STEM , which is essential in harnessing new technologies for future prosperity. The department leads national policy and programs to support community wide STEM engagement, including among girls, women and people from diverse backgrounds. These programs target the STEM pathway, partly to alter perceptions and increase understanding of STEM careers for young Australians. In September 2022, the government announced its plan to revitalise both the National Science and Research Priorities and the National Science Statement, to help shape the long term vision for Australia s science system. This process is intended to re energise conversations across the Australian science and research sector on the importance of STEM to deliver social, economic and environmental benefits for all Australians. The department will also consider the Pathway to Diversity in STEM Review outcomes when they are finalised in late 2023, as well as opportunities to strengthen this performance measure for continued alignment with our work. This performance measure considers 3 surveys conducted every 2 years covering parents, educators and young Australians perceptions of the importance of STEM. This year s result is drawn from the 2 surveys conducted in 2022 23 with parents and educators. The survey for young Australians was conducted and reported in 2021 22. The STEM Equity Monitor and survey results for 2022 23 were released in July 2023.27 27  44 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance The departmental programs included in this performance measure are Inspiring Australia Science Engagement Program National Science Week Prime Minister s Prizes for Science Citizen Science Grants Sponsorship grants for student science engagement and international competitions Maker Project Grants Targeted Science Communication Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship grants program Girls in STEM Toolkit Women in STEM Ambassador Women in STEM Ambassador national awareness raising initiative Advancing Women in STEM strategy Advancing Women in STEM 2020 Action Plan STEM Equity Monitor Superstars of STEM Science in Australia Gender Equity SAGE initiative Elevate Boosting Women in STEM scholarship. The surveys measure changes in attitudes and perceptions but do not gather qualitative data on why respondents provide their ratings. As such, it is difficult to analyse why the results differ from the target. It could be attributed to general shifts in the operating environment over the 2 years between surveys, such as the COVID 19 pandemic and the resulting disruption in education and engagement in extra curricular activities. The decrease in parents overall perceptions that STEM skills are important when considering employment is also reflected in their response to STEM skill specific questions science skills 76 down from 81 in the previous survey technology skills 87 down from 89 in the previous survey engineering skills 72 down from 75 in the previous survey mathematics skills 83 down from 89 in the previous survey . There were no changes in educators overall perceptions that STEM skills are important when considering employment.  Annual report 2022 23 45 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance Limitations This performance criteria has been chosen as a proxy for understanding national perceptions of the importance of STEM skills. There are limitations with attributing the direct impact of the department s STEM engagement programs on STEM participation due to factors outside of the department s control. It is also not practical economically to measure the response of an entire population. Therefore, representative sample results are used as a proxy. Each survey sample is analysed to ensure it represents the intended population. Weighting is applied in some cases for under or over representation within the sample and additional methodological information is available in research reports. This data is collected biennially through the Youth in STEM research report and the STEM influencers parents, teachers and career advisors research report produced by Youth Insight, which is the research arm of Student Edge that provides national surveys for government and industry organisations. 9.1 Percentage of Questacon s national STEM events reaching lower socio economic, regional and remote communities Target 2021 22 result 2022 23 result 50 national STEM events reaching lower socio economic communities 59 58 60 national STEM events reaching regional and remote communities 72 80 2022 23 assessment Met Analysis of result Questacon, the national science and technology centre, is contributing to the Australian community s engagement with science, technology and innovation. Questacon aims to highlight the value of science and technology in everyone s lives, the importance of developing STEM skills, and the future STEM careers can offer. Questacon is also committed to overcoming social disadvantage and geographic isolation as barriers to engagement. The government s investment in science and technology through Questacon s national STEM events and virtual programs enable Australians in schools and communities with limited access to a Canberra based Questacon experience to engage with science, technology and innovation wherever they are.  46 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance In 2022 23, national STEM events and virtual programs engaged 44,022 students, teachers, and members of the public across every state and territory. These programs are free to schools, reducing barriers to participation. An additional 249,214 participants interacted with Questacon s exhibits in informal learning institutions across the country. Schools volunteer to participate in Questacon s free national STEM programs following an opt in approach. Questacon markets and plans national STEM events in regional remote and low socio economic areas to share its vision of creating a better future for all Australians through engagement with science, technology and innovation. Questacon s national STEM event targets of 50 and 60 are used to provide flexibility in programming circumstances, as well as working into Questacon s national presence strategy. Background The 2022 23 reporting period is the first in which the department has established a performance measure relating to Questacon and the national STEM events programs. A benchmark target was set of 50 national STEM events engaging with lower socio economic communities, and 60 engaging regional and remote communities. The measure reflects the contribution of Questacon s outreach work in raising awareness of the importance of STEM. As Australia s national science and technology centre, Questacon supports community engagement with science, technology and innovation. In 2022 23, Questacon welcomed 464,297 visitors from the public and schools to enjoy exhibits, shows and inspirational learning experiences at its centre in Canberra. This was 164,297 higher than forecast in Questacon s 2022 23 planning. During 2022 23, 105,921 school students visited the centre on excursions, showing a slow return to pre pandemic averages of 150,000 students per year. Limitations Geo locational data was not available for 13 1.5 of the national STEM events 869 in total and were therefore excluded from the data used to calculate the result.  Annual report 2022 23 47 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance 10 Number of third party accreditations maintained to ensure NMI measurement services meet national and international best practice Target 2021 22 result 2022 23 result Maintain global acceptance of over 300 measurement capabilities under the Mutual Recognition Arrangement of the International Committee of Weights and Measures Maintain NMI s 24 National Association of Testing Authorities NATA accreditations across calibration and testing, reference material production, and proficiency testing functions Maintain World Anti Doping Agency WADA accreditation for NMI s sports drug testing capability New measure in 2022 23 313 25 Maintained 2022 23 assessment Met Analysis of result The National Measurement Institute NMI plays an important role in the Australian economy by leading Australia s measurement system. This work is driven by advances in science and technology to continuously adapt to, service and enhance the productivity and growth of Australian industry. Maintaining trusted national and international accreditation for our measurement laboratories, standards and services supports domestic and international trade. It provides assurance to consumers, governments and other stakeholders that Australian products and results across a range of sectors are underpinned by scientific expertise and infrastructure of the highest international standards. To meet these targets, NMI continuously maintains laboratories and capabilities at a suitable standard for these accreditations. For example, ISO IEC 17025, Testing and calibration laboratories, is the relevant standard for calibration laboratories, and sets out a range of requirements such as ensuring equipment is appropriately calibrated so results are accurate. Maintenance of these accreditations is achieved via internal and external audit processes, where NMI is required to demonstrate competency in performing the measurement services for which accreditation is held compliance with standard accreditation requirements.  48 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance Globally accepted measurement capabilities The Key Comparison Database maintained by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures BIPM lists 313 internationally recognised calibration and measurement capabilities CMCs for NMI, with 105 in chemistry and biology, and 208 in general physics. This maintains the level of CMCs from the previous financial year and exceeds the minimum requirement of 300 CMCs in this performance measure. Achieving and maintaining CMCs requires NMI to meet 3 fundamental criteria participation in scientific comparisons operation of an appropriate quality management system international peer review of claimed calibration and measurement capabilities.28 National Association of Testing Authorities accreditations NMI s 24 NATA accreditations across the functions of calibration and testing, reference material production, and proficiency testing that are part of this performance measure for 2022 23, were all maintained. The additional NATA accreditation attained in mid 2022 was also maintained, keeping the total number of NATA accreditations at 25. Each NATA accreditation is reassessed every 3 years, with a surveillance visit of the relevant laboratory at 18 months.29 NMI and its predecessor organisations have continuously maintained the accreditation required to deliver measurement standards and science for decades. In 2022 23, NMI celebrated the 70th anniversary of its oldest NATA accreditation, for sample analysis services delivered from its Melbourne laboratory. World Anti Doping Agency accreditation WADA accreditation for NMI s sports drug testing capability was maintained in such a way that services to Sport Integrity Australia were delivered as per the memorandum of understanding. A new certificate of accreditation received from WADA on 9 January 2022 authorises NMI s Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory to conduct doping control analyses from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. WADA accreditation is renewed annually. Amongst other requirements,30 accreditation must meet the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization s ISO IEC 17025 which is separately accredited by NATA. 28 More details on the approval process are available at 29 The accreditation process and requirements are available at nata.com.au accreditation how to get accredited. 30 Accreditation requirements are detailed at  Annual report 2022 23 49 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance Key activity 1.3 supporting a strong resources sector This activity aims to support the sustainable development of the resources sector, attract private sector investment and encourage innovative technologies. It relates to PBS 2022 23 Outcome 1, Program 1.3. 11 Grow Australia s critical minerals sector, including by supporting development of downstream processing capacity Target 2021 22 result 2022 23 result31 Year on year increase in the number, progress and total capital expenditure of critical minerals projects Estimated value Project pipeline32 Publicly announced Feasibility Committed Completed 22 36 billion 71 16 41 12 2 30 42 billion 81 21 44 13 3 2022 23 assessment Met Analysis of result Growing the critical minerals sector in Australia will deliver strong economic benefits, including increased trade and job creation. The Critical Minerals Strategy 2023 2030 positions Australia as an ethical, reliable and secure supplier of critical minerals within global supply chains. The department is responsible for supporting this growth, including in relation to development of downstream processing capability. The 2022 Resources and energy major projects REMP report noted, Australia s critical minerals major project pipeline comprised 81 projects in this year s report, with an estimated value of 30 42 billion . Using the current methodology there were 71 projects for the 2021 22 reporting period.33 31 As reported in the 2022 REMP report. 32 The definitions for each stage are provided in the methodology section of each report. 33 The Annual report 2021 22 reported a project pipeline figure of 69. For consistency and ease of comparison, the 2021 22 result in this report uses the Critical Minerals List applied in the 2022 REMP report from which the 2022 23 result is derived. The increased project pipeline 2021 22 figure reflects the inclusion of 2 high purity alumina projects.  50 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance Through the Critical Minerals Development Program, the government approved close to 100 million in grants across 19 projects to help progress early and mid stage critical minerals projects towards financing and production, targeting those undertaking downstream processing activities. The department s activities also contribute to diversifying global supply chains and positioning Australia as an ethical, reliable and secure suppler of critical minerals. Our activities included facilitating strategically important critical minerals projects partnering with other countries to build global supply chains supporting research and development working to align Australia s policy and regulatory settings to better support investment and unlock downstream processing and manufacturing opportunities improving access to information about regulatory approvals, funding and investment promoting investment and identifying global opportunities. We publish the data underpinning this performance measure the REMP report at Limitations While a significant contributor to this measure, there are many factors outside of government control which contribute to the achievement of this target, such as investment being subject to market fluctuations. Still, the chosen metric remains the most appropriate metric for assessing the impact of government efforts to grow the sector given its robust methodology, transparency, efficiency, and ongoing applicability. The focus of the REMP report is solely on major investments valued at over 50 million each based on publicly available sources . The report and this performance measure does not reflect the substantial investment by mining and energy companies in replenishing equipment, plant and other property. Full methodology of data collection and analysis is provided in the REMP reports. Changes to Australia s Critical Minerals List affect projects and aggregate figures reported in the REMP report refer to the analysis of result for the impact on the 2021 22 to 2022 23 reporting periods . Should the list be updated, discontinuities will be clearly identified in performance reporting analyses.  Annual report 2022 23 51 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance 12 Increase opportunities for resources project investment 2022 23 target 2021 22 result 2022 23 result At least one of the following the release of acreage for petroleum exploration greenhouse gas storage exploration the award of titles for petroleum exploration greenhouse gas storage exploration New measure in 2022 23 1 5 2022 23 assessment Met Analysis of result Releasing offshore acreage and awarding new permits for petroleum and greenhouse gas storage exploration can support investment in the offshore resources sector and facilitate the abatement of carbon emissions. New investment supports a strong resources sector and is a driver for the creation of high skilled jobs in regional Australia. The department manages and facilitates the acreage release process which includes stakeholder consultation across government and the broader public. Consultation supports identification and consideration of any potential impacts of exploration activity in an area, including impacts to First Nations cultural heritage, the environment, other marine users such as tourism and fishing industries and communities. The department ensures legislative requirements are met and decisions to award permits are supported by robust, evidence based advice. One offshore petroleum exploration acreage release occurred in 2022 23, comprising 10 areas in Commonwealth waters off Western Australia, Victoria, and the Ashmore and Cartier Islands. Five offshore greenhouse gas storage assessment permits were also awarded during 2022 23, in conclusion of the 2021 Offshore Greenhouse Gas Storage Acreage release. The permits are located in Commonwealth waters offshore Western Australia and the Northern Territory.34 34  52 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 2 Departmental report on performance 13 National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator NOPTA published assessment timeframes for applications made under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Storage Act 2006 OPGGS Act are met Target 2021 22 result 2022 23 result 90 93 97 2022 23 assessment Met Analysis of result NOPTA, within the department, is responsible for the efficient and effective regulation of Australia s offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas GHG activities. As part of this role, it administers petroleum and GHG titles in Australian Commonwealth waters in accordance with the OPGGS Act. Processing applications that meet published timeframes35 provides transparency and accountability to government and industry. It supports a strong offshore resources sector by creating business certainty and can assist with managing project timelines within energy markets that continue to evolve. Application assessment target timeframes for Joint Authority related decisions were agreed by the Joint Authority in 2015.36 In 2019, NOPTA developed indicative assessment timeframes for Titles Administrator decisions. In 2022 23, NOPTA finalised 382 applications, with 97 of all applications assessed within the published timeframes for assessment. This is an aggregated figure of both petroleum and GHG applications. The improvement in the result for 2022 23 compared with 2021 22 was due to multiple factors including 115 fewer applications and less decisions made on technically complex applications improvements to processes and procedures such as monthly application debrief sessions. 35 36 The Joint Authority for the offshore area off each state except Tasmania and the Northern Territory is constituted by the responsible Commonwealth minister and the relevant state or Northern Territory minister.

In 2022 23, we established a consolidated Integrity Branch that brought together the department s risk, protective security, anti fraud and corruption, public interest disclosure, and code of conduct functions. This central capability improves the coordination of integrity matters, provides an easier way for our people to seek support, and facilitates our engagement with the new National Anti Corruption Commission. Risk management Effective engagement and management of risk is central to how we meet government and community expectations. We recognise that in some circumstances it is not possible or desirable to eliminate all risk, and that accepting a degree of risk allows us to seize opportunities, promote efficiencies and support innovation. Our Risk Management Framework is consistent with the Commonwealth Risk Management Policy and aligns with the Australian Standard ISO 31000 2018, Risk management Guidelines. It sets out a systematic approach to risk management that enables us to engage with risk in a way that builds a positive risk culture. Risk management is also embedded in our broader policies, processes and systems. As part of our commitment to continuous improvement, we have strengthened risk reporting by developing and testing a new enterprise risk reporting process. This new process ensures our executive is quickly made aware of, and can respond to, changes to enterprise risk status. Climate related risk management and reporting We have a responsibility to manage climate related risks associated with our operations and support the government s policy on climate change, Australian Public Service APS Net Zero 2030. Our first reporting under the APS Net Zero policy is at Appendix A4. We aim to improve our approach to climate related risk management over time, including by engaging with the new Climate Risk and Opportunity Management Program. To implement our response to the APS Net Zero policy, we also plan to use training material and tools being developed by Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water DCCEEW to enhance the ability of the APS to identify, assess, prioritise, manage and disclose climate risks and opportunities.  Annual report 2022 23 61 Chapter 3 Departmental management and accountability Fraud control Our approach to fraud control is consistent with the Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework 2017 and involves prevention raising awareness, assessing risk and providing training as the first line of defence detection monitoring high risk areas and using proactive analysis to detect possible fraud investigation and response investigating and assessing allegations, and referrals and recovery monitoring and evaluation ensuring that our approach to fraud control is designed and operates effectively, and that it remains fit for purpose. We continue to actively raise awareness about emerging fraud risks and provide advice on potential fraud and mitigation strategies for new programs and initiatives. Officers responsible for fraud control and investigations hold the qualifications required by the Australian Government Investigations Standards and the Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework. Compliance with finance law There were no instances of significant non compliance reported to the relevant minister as part of the department s internal compliance reporting process for the 2022 23 financial year.  62 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 3 Departmental management and accountability External scrutiny Our operations are subject to oversight by several external bodies, including parliamentary committees, the Australian National Audit Office ANAO , the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Information Commissioner AIC and the courts and administrative tribunals. In 2022 23, no judicial decisions, decisions of administrative tribunals or decisions by the AIC had a significant impact on our operations. No capability reviews were released, and no reports on our operations were completed by either the Commonwealth Ombudsman a committee of either or both houses of parliament. In 2022 23, the ANAO tabled 2 performance audits involving the department Award of funding under the Building Better Regions Fund Procurement complaints handling. Details of these audits, and other ANAO audits in progress at 30 June 2023 that relate to the department, are available on the ANAO website at Audits in progress include the ANAO s annual performance statements audit, of which the department is included for the first time in 2022 23. Information Publication Scheme Under Part II, section 8 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982, we are required to publish information as part of the Information Publication Scheme. Our website at shows the information published in accordance with the scheme. Our capability Engaged and inclusive workforce Our ambition to be a model employer and contribute to an APS that serves our community and country is at the centre of our human resources offering. In 2022 23, we supported our people and capability in line with this ambition, including as we managed the transition of functions following the machinery of government changes announced on 1 June 2022. We delivered several capability building activities. These included launching a pilot mentoring program for our diversity networks and STEM graduates. The program enhances our approach to learning through others and is aligned to the APS Learning and Development Strategy and Action Plan.  Annual report 2022 23 63 Chapter 3 Departmental management and accountability In addition, we supported professional development and learning through coaching and study assistance programs. A broad range of courses, including on project management and approaches to performance conversations, were delivered virtually for staff in all locations to access. We continue to have a strong focus on building inclusion and diversity. In 2022 23, we demonstrated this commitment through the launch of our Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan our affirmative measures recruitment process for people with a disability hosting the APS Pride Summit participation in the Stepping Into Internship program for university students with a disability celebration of 7 diversity dates of significance. The department has 5 employee led diversity networks. These are Cultural and Linguistic Diversity Network Disability and Wellness Network Gender Equity Network Indigenous Employee Network Pride Network. These networks play a critical role in providing our people with a safe and supportive work environment. They also make significant contributions to positive cultural change in the department. In March 2023, we completed an update of mandatory e learning, including our unit on conflict of interest. Staff members also completed foundational courses to assist them in understanding legislative requirements, APS values and workplace behaviours. By leveraging our national footprint and information communication technology ICT , we continued to provide a flexible workplace for our people during 2022 23. To facilitate this, we also consulted with staff members about our flexible work approach to align a greater range of flexible work options and decision making to direct managers. In support of these arrangements, the department developed increased guidance for managers and employees in line with the APS Commission s principles for flexible work.  64 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 3 Departmental management and accountability Figure 6 Our inclusive workforce highlights for 2022 23 2020 2021 2022 2025 Our target 8 10 9 9 Disability representation APS target 7 14 university students were offered paid non ongoing internships 3 interns were offered new non ongoing contracts and one intern has since become an ongoing employee Access and Inclusion Index Ranked 7th out of 33 participating organisations We won the Best in Class for ICT award Disability Afﬁrmative Measures Round From the 2022 23 recruitment round We have been exceeding the APS target for the last 3 years for enhancing and raising awareness of digital accessibility across the department positions have been ﬁlled with candidates remotely working around Australia 12 2 1 1 3 5 Stepping Into Internship Program Inclusive and safe workplace for those with or without disability, carers and staff allies members of the Disability and Wellness Network DaWN 100 New disability contact ofﬁcer person to person help navigating systems and connecting people with resources and supports they need.

In line with this, we established the Integrity Branch to strengthen our integrity practice and capacity. The new branch brought together existing capability across the department, including to consolidate our security and integrity offerings. We also established a new Grants Delivery and Business Services Division as a centre of excellence for grants delivery. This brings together our Business Grants Hub, Integrity Branch and Portfolio Program Delivery Branch to strengthen our offering. To support the government to drive productivity across the APS, we provided payroll and financial management systems to 12 government agencies besides the department. The delivery of repeatable and reusable solutions reduced system duplication and provided a consistent user experience across government. We are contributing to APS wide improvements in capability uplift through the department s membership of the Future of Work, Chief Operating Officer, Partnerships Priorities, and the Digital and Data sub committees of the Secretaries Board, which provides advice to the Secretaries Board on workforce capability and approaches to positioning the APS as an employer of choice.  66 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 3 Departmental management and accountability Senior leadership capability We are committed to leadership performance and development arrangements that support organisational performance. To support this, we reviewed the Senior Executive Service SES performance framework, ensuring that both outputs and behaviours of the SES cohort were included as key components of their performance indicators. The revised framework will be implemented during the 2023 24 performance cycle and will provide SES with strengthened accountability and a clearer alignment to targeted development opportunities. In 2022 23, our SES cohort undertook a range of initiatives to improve our capability. These included the APS Commission s SES Orientation Program and the Deputy Secretary Leadership Council. Our Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan commits the department to improving SES cultural competency. SES are encouraged to undertake immersive cultural learning experiences such as attending the Garma Festival and completing Acknowledge this training. The department continued its focus on building inclusive leadership. In 2022 23, this included refreshing our SES executive diversity champions cohort with 10 SES commencing in new champion roles, Acknowledgement of Country training for our SES, a Garma Festival delegation which included 3 SES officers, and an SES drop in session on Australia s Disability Strategy. In December 2022, we brought our leadership group together for an SES forum to explore how members could build their leadership capability by enhancing their curiosity and approach to connecting and collaborating. Australian Government Graduate Program Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics stream We facilitated the recruitment and placement for the Australian Government Graduate Program AGGP Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics STEM stream for the third year. This program successfully recruits and places STEM graduates and future leaders in participating agencies. For the 2023 intake, graduate numbers increased by 275 with 44 graduates placed across 15 agencies. This represents the largest cohort for the program to date. In addition to participating in their agency s graduate development program, STEM graduates are invited to attend several networking events during the 12 month program. These events give them the opportunity to interact with STEM leaders within the APS. Networking events hosted for STEM graduates included experiences at Questacon, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation CSIRO , Geoscience Australia and the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex.  Annual report 2022 23 67 Chapter 3 Departmental management and accountability Australian Science Policy Fellowship Program Established in 2018, the Australian Science Policy Fellowship Program is an initiative led by the Office of the Chief Scientist that gives scientists the opportunity to work in a policy role in the APS for up to 12 months. The aim of the program is to strengthen connections between science and policy by bringing science and technology expertise into public policy processes and bringing experience of government processes and policymaking into academia. In 2022 23, 13 science policy fellows participated in the program and were hosted by 8 Commonwealth entities. We recruited a further 18 fellows to participate in the 2023 24 program across 11 host entities. Demand has remained strong with 15 entities submitting 43 expressions of interest to host fellows in the 2023 24 program. Applications from potential fellows rose from 32 for the 2022 23 program to 87 for the 2023 24 program, the highest number of applications since the program was established. Feedback from 2022 23 fellows demonstrated the value of the program, which provides scientists with a pathway into the APS. The program also gives scientists an opportunity to understand government processes and apply their transferrable skills to policy development. Many 2022 23 fellows have since taken up ongoing roles in the APS. Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan 2023 26 In April 2023, we launched our first Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan after completing 2 consecutive Innovate Reconciliation Action Plans. This is a significant step in our reconciliation journey and is the culmination of extensive consultation open to all staff, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff members. Staff contributed to the development of the Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan through activities such as divisional workshops, design sessions and a national roadshow. Under the plan, our vision for reconciliation is to value, understand, engage with, respect, and embrace Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples innovations, knowledge and cultures. We will also strengthen our organisation s cultural capabilities and improve Australia s economic and social opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We have set ambitious, yet achievable targets over a 3 year period. These include a strong focus on building cultural capability, increasing First Nations representation in our workforce and engaging with First Nations peoples, communities, and businesses. In 2022 23, we continued to progress reconciliation by conducting an affirmative measures SES recruitment round, resulting in 2 placements and increasing representation in our SES cohort from 1 to 3 engaging 8 First Nations apprentices through the APS Indigenous Apprenticeship Program hosting an Indigenous Employee Network Forum that brought together more than 40 First Nations staff members promoting the Pat Turner Scholarship, with the department s first scholar being accepted to participate in the program participating in the 2022 Garma Festival with an 8 person delegation representing the department.  68 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 3 Departmental management and accountability Inclusive leadership We continued to build leadership capabilities in inclusivity. In 2022 23, staff completed online training courses in cultural competency, disability awareness, cultural and linguistic diversity, LGBTQIA inclusivity and gender equity. We also gave our people opportunities to undertake Acknowledgement of Country training to build their understanding of this important cultural protocol and give them the confidence and capability to deliver it. As part of inclusivity development opportunities for our leaders managers participated in our disability affirmative measures round where they undertook unconscious bias and reasonable adjustment training managers of First Nations staff participated in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mental health first aid training leaders of our staff led diversity networks attended a conference or seminar relevant to their roles. Work health and safety, including psychological wellbeing We are committed to the health, safety and wellbeing of our workers and visitors. Throughout 2022 23, we focused on initiatives to promote and increase the wellbeing and psychosocial safety of staff. These included continuing to refine and tailor our holistic wellbeing package, which comprises information sessions and tools to prevent injury and illness, and promote wellbeing launching Compassionate Foundations training, which aims to give people the skills to support a person experiencing suicidal thoughts learning and development programs to enable managers and employees to find the language and confidence to discuss difficult issues putting safety moments on the agenda in meetings, to normalise discussion and reduce stigma around mental health and wellbeing flexible work arrangements and making them easier to access, to support staff wellbeing analysing data and reporting to provide leaders with evidence based information for making better business decisions and identifying hot spots for early intervention. On 1 April 2023, model work health and safety laws took effect that include psychological health risks under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 WHS Act . Our department continues to be well placed to respond to these changes by building on the action plans established following a 2021 22 Australian Public Service Commission APSC maturity scale assessment.  Annual report 2022 23 69 Chapter 3 Departmental management and accountability Other activities by the department to address safety included training and appointing new health and safety representatives at Questacon, who continue to identify initiatives to improve safety hosting toolbox talks with Questacon s staff to discuss and resolve work health and safety issues monitoring of the effectiveness of work health and safety management systems by the National Measurement Institute NMI through regular safety reviews. In 2022 23, 6 matters were deemed notifiable under section 38 of the WHS Act and reported to Comcare. One investigation was conducted and zero notices were issued under Part 10 of the WHS Act. One matter was being investigated at 30 June 2023. Digital and cyber capability We take a strategic approach to ensure digital work programs consider the sustainability of our ICT environment, deliver policy outcomes and efficiency improvements, and have investment predictability. This is evident in our Digital Modernisation Program that is transforming our core ICT service, aligning it with the global transition to cloud computing and addressing emerging risks and challenges. It also gives staff members access to new technology while ensuring the financial sustainability of our digital operating environment. Staff members can now access Microsoft Teams on all departmental devices. We have also moved away from on premises solutions to modern cloud based computing that supports better access, sharing, and security of digital information. As a result, our people are having more opportunities to flexibly collaborate in a post COVID distributed work environment. We provide responsive and expert support in the delivery of digital initiatives, programs, and systems. As a part of this, our focus remains fixed on the end user experience to ensure ICT is easy to use, responsive to user needs and accessible for all. To this end, we now lead the way in the APS in terms of digital accessibility for people living with a disability. In 2022 23, we were awarded best in class for ICT in the latest Australian Network on Disability Access and Inclusion Index, an industry benchmark for assessing the accessibility maturity of organisations. Our cyber security focus is on reducing the risk and impacts of cyber attacks, helping to maintain government and community trust, and confidence in our management of the systems and data we hold. In 2022 23, we continued to strengthen our cyber defences and resilience by implementing a Cyber Security Uplift Program dedicated to improving our maturity against the Australian Cyber Security Centre s Essential Eight Maturity Model and the Protective Security Policy Framework. Protecting our organisation and clients from cyber threats and data breaches will remain a focus area in 2023 24, as we continue to further mature our cyber capabilities and protections.   70 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 3 Departmental management and accountability Executive remuneration This executive remuneration disclosure covers key management personnel as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards Board AASB in Table 9 SES employees in Table 10 other highly paid staff members whose total remuneration exceeds the threshold remuneration result for the 2022 23 reporting period of 240,000 in Table 11.

After taking into account depreciation and amortisation, the impacts of AASB 16 Leases accounting adjustments and changes in the asset revaluation reserve, the department recorded a surplus of 18.9 million for 2022 23. This reflects net cash appropriation arrangements where there is no appropriation for depreciation and amortisation expenses, as entities receive a separate capital budget provided through equity appropriations. The surplus is largely due to delays in implementation of various budget measures. Financial sustainability As at 30 June 2023, the department reported net assets of 305.7 million. The department has sufficient financial and non financial assets to settle its payables as and when they fall due. Non financial assets owned by the department consist of property buildings and fit out , plant and equipment owned by the department. Financial performance administered Income Administered revenue largely relates to royalty revenue 2,052.0 million , levy receipts generated by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority 41.2 million and registration fees generated by the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator 16.2 million . Expenses During the year the department administered programs on behalf of the government, including 409.6 million to building and investing in science and technology 480.9 million to support the growth of innovative and competitive businesses, industries and regions 575.2 million to support a strong resources sector 1,330.1 million in payments to the portfolio s corporate Commonwealth entities including the CSIRO Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ANSTO National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority NOPSEMA .

Our internal policies support our employees to undertake procurement activities that meet these requirements. In accordance with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, we published our Annual Procurement Plan on the AusTender website to give prospective suppliers the opportunity to prepare for potential work. This information is available at We also support small business participation in the Australian Government procurement market. Participations statistics involving small and medium enterprises SMEs are available on the Department of Finance s website at In accordance with paragraph 5.4 of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, we have procurement practices and internal policies in place to ensure that SMEs are not unfairly discriminated against. These measures include, but are not limited to mandatory use of the Commonwealth Contracting Suite for all low risk procurements up to 200,000 including GST procurement training, including contracting with SMEs online procurement guidance to provide advice to procuring officers. We recognise the importance of ensuring that small businesses are paid on time. The Treasury publishes the results of the Survey of Australian Government Payments to Small Business on its website at We support the Indigenous Procurement Policy IPP to ensure that opportunities for Indigenous employment and business continue to grow.

The financial statements of the Entity, which I have audited, comprise the following as at 30 June 2023 and for the year then ended Statement by the Secretary and Chief Finance Officer Statement of Comprehensive Income Statement of Financial Position Statement of Changes in Equity Cash Flow Statement Administered Schedule of Comprehensive Income Administered Schedule of Assets and Liabilities Administered Reconciliation Schedule Administered Cash Flow Statement and Notes to and forming part of the financial statements, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Basis for opinion I conducted my audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which incorporate the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Entity in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements for financial statement audits conducted by the Auditor General and his delegates. These include the relevant independence requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants including Independence Standards the Code to the extent that they are not in conflict with the Auditor General Act 1997. I have also fulfilled my other responsibilities in accordance with the Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgement, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  Annual report 2022 23 87 Chapter 4 Departmental financial statements Key audit matter Completeness and accuracy of royalty revenue Refer Administered Schedule of Comprehensive Income, Non taxation revenue Royalties I focused on this balance given the significant value of royalty revenue recognised by the Entity and the complexities associated with its administration. The collection of royalties is reliant on data reporting and administrative functions performed by third parties, including State governments and other federal government agencies. The royalty calculations are also dependent on information provided by taxpayers in a self assessment regime. This reliance on information sourced from third parties increases the risk that royalty revenue reported may be incomplete or inaccurate. The effectiveness of the Entity s assurance framework over the collection and administration of royalties is important to reduce the risk of recording incomplete or inaccurate revenue. For the year ended 30 June 2023, the Entity reported royalty revenue of 2,052.0 million. How the audit addressed the matter The audit procedures I undertook to address the matter included assessing the effectiveness of the Entity s framework for assuring the completeness and accuracy of North West Shelf royalty revenue collections, activities relating to the collection of Joint Petroleum Development Area royalties testing, on a sample basis, a selection of internal controls undertaken by the Entity to assure the completeness and accuracy of royalty revenue examining, on a sample basis, records generated by third parties that are used to calculate the value of royalty incurring transactions to assess the accuracy of royalty revenue recognised for 2022 23 assessing the completeness of royalty revenue by examining large royalties payments received after 30 June 2023 in order to identify any royalty revenue that should have been recorded for 2022 23 and assessing the reasonableness of royalty revenue by analysing the relationship between production and commodity prices and the amount of revenue recognised. Key audit matter Valuation of the Rehabilitation Provision Refer to Note 4.5 Rehabilitation Provision I focused on this area due to the size of the balance and the judgement involved in estimating the value of the rehabilitation provision. The provision comprises the cost relating to the rehabilitation of the Ranger Uranium Mine following its closure in January 2021 and the costs relating to the decommissioning of the Northern Endeavour Floating Production Storage and Offtake FPSO facility and associated Laminaria Corallina oil fields. These provisions are calculated using estimated rehabilitation cost information, including estimates derived by third parties and are underpinned by key assumptions including the cost and scope of the rehabilitation activities, discount rates, indexation and inflation rates and the estimated timing of cash outflows. The balance at 30 June 2023 was 2,062.5 million. How the audit addressed the matter The audit procedures I undertook to address the matter included evaluating the methodology used to estimate future rehabilitation costs, including the assessment of any key assumptions made by the Entity assessing the completeness and accuracy of data used by the Entity to calculate the estimate and recalculating the provision using the estimation inputs including costing data, inflation and discount rates.  88 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 4 Departmental financial statements Accountable Authority s responsibility for the financial statements As the Accountable Authority of the Entity, the Secretary is responsible under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 the Act for the preparation and fair presentation of annual financial statements that comply with Australian Accounting Standards Reduced Disclosure Requirements and the rules made under the Act. The Secretary is also responsible for such internal control as the Secretary determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Secretary is responsible for assessing the ability of the Entity to continue as a going concern, taking into account whether the Entity s operations will cease as a result of an administrative restructure or for any other reason. The Secretary is also responsible for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the assessment indicates that it is not appropriate. Auditor s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Entity s internal control evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Accountable Authority conclude on the appropriateness of the Accountable Authority s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Entity s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern and evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. I communicate with the Accountable Authority regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit. From the matters communicated with the Accountable Authority, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The variance in intangibles relates to lower than expected capital expenditure on software development projects due to resourcing and planning delays. The variances for revenue from contracts with customers largely relates to higher than expected revenue from increased scientific educational, measurement and services provided to other Australian Government entities under the Memorandum of Understanding arrangements including information technology and corporate services largely driven by the machinery of government changes. The variance in other and trade receivables is due to timing of receipts from these revenue from contracts with customers. The variance in suppliers expense was primarily due to reduced use of consultants during the financial year because of machinery of government changes, project delays, and reduced legal costs. The variance in revenue from government was a result of quarantined annual appropriations for administration purposes. The variance in other payables was largely due to timing of receipt of invoices and payments for employees transferred out of the department. The variance in Equity Injection Appropriations relates to current year s appropriation withheld under section 51 and reduction of appropriation due to section 75 transfers in accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. The variance in Contributed equity Restructuring is due to machinery of government changes. Statement of Financial Position Intangibles 39 million .

Budget Variances Commentary The below table provides commentary for major differences between the actual and the original budgeted amounts that were first presented to Parliament in respect of the reporting period from the department s 2022 23 October Portfolio Budget Statements PBS .

The department s central location is in Canberra, ACT and has offices throughout Australia. The department s purpose is to help the government build a better future for all Australians through a productive, resilient and sustainable economy enriched by science and technology. The department conducts the following administered activities on behalf of the Australian Government Growing innovative and competitive businesses, industries and regions Investing in science and technology and Supporting a strong resources sector. The continued existence of the department in its present form and with its present programs is dependent on Government policy and on continuing funding by Parliament for the department s administration and programs. Basis of Preparation The financial statements are general purpose financial statements and are required by section 42 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 PGPA Act . The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Financial Reporting Rule 2015 FRR and Australian Accounting Standards AAS and Interpretations including simplified disclosures for Tier 2 entities under AASB 1060 issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board AASB that apply for the reporting period. Administered financial assets, administered financial instruments, administered fair value measurement disclosures are prepared on a Tier 1 basis, as per section 18 3 of the FRR and net cash appropriation arrangements. The financial statements and notes have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise specified. New Accounting Standards Adoption of New Australian Accounting Standard Requirements Two amending standards AASB 2021 2 and AASB 2021 6 were adopted earlier than the application date as stated in the standard. These amending standards have been adopted for the 2022 23 reporting period. The following amending standards were issued prior to the signing of the statement by the accountable authority and chief finance officer, were applicable to the current reporting period AASB 2021 2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Disclosure of Accounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates amends AASB 7, AASB 101, AASB 108, AASB 134 and AASB Practice Statement 2. The amending standard requires the disclosure of material, rather than significant, accounting policies, and clarifies what is considered a change in accounting policy compared to a change in accounting estimate. AASB 2021 6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Disclosure of Accounting Policies Tier 2 and Other Australian Accounting Standards amends the Tier 2 reporting requirements set out in AASB 1049, AASB 1054 and AASB 1060 to reflect the changes made by AASB 2021 2. These amending standards are not considered to have a material impact on the department s financial statements for the current reporting period or future reporting periods.  Annual report 2022 23 105 Chapter 4 Departmental financial statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements Estimation Uncertainty Estimation uncertainty with material impact on the amounts recorded in the financial statements relates to Ranger rehabilitation provision. The rehabilitation provision is based on management s best estimate of the costs to rehabilitate the Ranger project area. The basis for the estimate includes assumptions and judgements about future events that have not transpired. A detailed review of required rehabilitation activities and estimated costs is currently being undertaken by Energy Resources Australia. The results will be available late 2023 which will likely result in changes to the provision amount during 2023 24. The value of provisions may also vary from year to year due to changes in estimated indexation factors and discount rates at the reporting date. Northern Endeavour rehabilitation provision. This provision represents the estimated future cost of decommissioning the Northern Endeavour Floating Production Storage and Offtake facility and remediating the associated Laminaria and Corallina oil fields. Decommissioning and remediation involve three phases of work. The Phase 1 cost estimate is based on contract costs for various work packages. The phases 2 and 3 cost estimate which were adjusted for cost uplifts and escalated are based on an independent assessment undertaken in 2020 which had a low level of project definition and reference to subject market experts and other key stakeholders. The future approach to completion of Phases 2 and 3 works has not been detailed yet and therefore the final outcome will differ to the provision. More accurate cost estimate information is expected to be available during 2023 24 which will likely result in changes to the provision amount during 2023 24. Maralinga provision. The provision is based on management s best estimate of the costs to remove non radiological general waste debris. The basis for the estimate includes assumptions and judgements about future events that have not transpired. More accurate cost estimate information is expected to be available during 2023 24 which will likely result in changes to the provision amount during 2023 24. Machinery of Government Changes The climate change and energy functions were transferred to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water as a result of an Administrative Arrangements Order effective from 1 July 2022. A number of portfolio bodies and offices also transferred as a result of these Machinery of Government changes. Assets transferred included administered investments in Snowy Hydro Limited SHL , Clean Energy Finance Corporation CEFC , Australian Institute of Marine Science AIMS , Australian Renewable Energy Agency ARENA , the CEFC special account, and the departmental Energy special account. The department assumed some functions that were previously the responsibility of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. The impact of machinery of government changes has resulted in differences when comparing current to prior year financial information in the Financial Statements. Details of assets and liabilities assumed and relinquished are outlined in Note 8.3. Reporting of Administered activities Administered revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows are disclosed in the administered schedules and related notes. Except where otherwise stated, administered items are accounted for on the same basis and using the same policies as for departmental items, including the application of Australian Accounting Standards. Administered activities are shown as shaded. Taxation The department is exempt from all forms of taxation except Fringe Benefits Tax FBT and the Goods and Services Tax GST .  106 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 4 Departmental financial statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements Breach of Section 83 of the Constitution Section 83 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 the Constitution provides that no amount may be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund except under an appropriation by law. In 2022 23, the department identified one payment that did not meet the statutory conditions for payment under Section 83, which resulted in one confirmed breach of the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator NOPTA Special Account under section 695K of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 OPGGS Act . The confirmed Section 83 breach relating to the payment made from the NOPTA Special Account was for a payment of 43,954 for services provided to the department, rather than for services provided to NOPTA. Upon identification of this breach corrective action was taken on 6 July 2023 for the NOPTA special account to recover the amount incorrectly paid. Events After the Reporting Period There were no events occurring after 30 June 2023 that would have a material impact on these financial statements.

The department recognises revenue when the performance obligations are required by an enforceable contract and are sufficiently specific to enable the department to identify when they have been satisfied. The majority of the departmental revenues are specified in legally enforceable contracts or Memoranda of Understanding MoUs where it is reasonable to expect that parties will act on their obligations and there are consequences for non performance. The principal activities from which the department generates its revenue relate to a Grant administration service The department s performance obligation is the provision of grant administration services to other Australian Government entities in accordance with MoUs. Revenue is recognised over time where the services are provided and consumed simultaneously. b Measurement services and products The National Measurement Institute NMI , a division of the department provides a wide range of chemical and biological analysis services. Agreements range from formalised contracts and MoUs with large government and private sector customers, to one off requests. All are enforceable and considered within the context of AASB 15. Recognition of revenue will align with the point in time that revenue is invoiced for the service. c Science and educational services Questacon, a division of the department, recognises revenue from memberships, subscriptions, and facility visits, including interactive science and technology related exhibits. The revenue is recognised at the time services are provided. d IT Project services and Shared services the department has performance obligations under several MoU s with other government related entities.

Annual report 2022 23 117 Chapter 4 Departmental financial statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements Accounting Policy Acquisition of Assets Assets are recorded at cost on acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Financial assets are initially measured at their fair value plus transaction costs where appropriate. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets and income at their fair value at the date of acquisition, unless acquired as a consequence of restructuring of administrative arrangements. In the latter case, assets are initially recognised as contributions by owners at the amounts at which they were recognised in the transferor s accounts immediately prior to the restructuring. Asset Recognition Threshold Purchases of infrastructure, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the statement of financial position, except for items of property with a project cost less than 10,000 which are expensed in the year of acquisition and items of plant and equipment costing less than 5,000 which are expensed in the year of acquisition other than where they form part of a group of similar items which individually cost less than 5,000 but collectively cost 50,000 or more, which are recognised in the statement of financial position . The initial cost of an asset includes an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. This is particularly relevant to make good provisions in property leases taken up by the department where there exists an obligation to restore the property to its original condition. These costs are included in the value of the department s buildings and leasehold improvements with a corresponding provision for the make good recognised. Leased Right of Use ROU Assets Leased ROU assets are capitalised at the commencement date of the lease and comprise of the initial lease liability amount, initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease less any lease incentives received. These assets are accounted for by Commonwealth lessees as separate asset classes to corresponding assets owned outright but included in the same column as where the corresponding underlying assets would be presented if they were owned. An impairment review is undertaken annually for any right of use lease asset that shows indicators of impairment and an impairment loss is recognised against any right of use lease asset that is impaired. Leased ROU assets continue to be measured at cost after initial recognition. Revaluations Following initial recognition at cost, infrastructure, plant and equipment excluding ROU asset are carried at fair value less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The department conducts asset revaluation on a three year rolling revaluation cycle. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not differ materially from the assets fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuation depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. The buildings and leasehold improvement asset classes were revalued effective 30 June 2023 by Pickles using a fair value basis. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of asset revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class that was previously recognised in the surplus deficit. Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly in the surplus deficit except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset is restated to the revalued amount. Depreciation Depreciable infrastructure, plant and equipment assets are written off to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives to the department, using, in all cases, the straight line method of depreciation. Depreciation rates useful lives , residual values and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are made in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives  118 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 4 Departmental financial statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements 2023 2022 Buildings 8 40 years 8 40 years Leasehold improvements Lease term Lease term Laboratory equipment 3 10 years 3 10 years Infrastructure, plant and equipment 3 10 years 3 10 years The depreciation rates for ROU assets are based on the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the ROU asset or the end of the lease term. Impairment All assets were assessed for impairment at 30 June 2023 and the result reported in Note 3.2A and 4.2A. Where indications of impairment exist, the asset s recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment made if the asset s recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. The impairment adjustment is reflected in the gross carrying value of the asset. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset s ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the department were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. Derecognition An item of infrastructure, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Intangibles The department s intangibles comprise both internally developed and purchased software for internal use. These assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Purchases of software with a value of less than 50,000 and internally developed software with a value of less than 200,000 are expensed in the year of acquisition. Bulk purchases of software that individually cost less than 50,000, but as a group cost 50,000 or more are recognised in the statement of financial position. Software is amortised on a straight line basis over its anticipated useful life. The useful lives of the department s software are 3 to 15 years 2022 3 to 15 years . Inventories Inventories held for sale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories comprise of chemical reference materials CRMs , work in progress for CRMs and laboratory consumables. 2022 Administered inventories comprised coal which was held for distribution and valued at cost .

The above lease disclosures should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Notes 1.1B, 1.1D, and 3.2A. Accounting Policy For all new contracts entered into, the department considers whether the contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset the underlying asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration . Once it has been determined that a contract is, or contains a lease, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable, or the department s incremental borrowing rate. Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification to the lease. When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right of use asset or profit and loss depending on the nature of the reassessment or modification. 3.5.

Loans, trade and other receivables are held for the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows, which are solely payments of principal and interest, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method adjusted for any loss allowance. Both loans and receivables are assessed for impairment at end of each reporting period. The department has adopted the general approach to measure the impairment loss allowance for its administered loans. For trade and other receivables, the simplified approach has been adopted in measuring the impairment loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss ECL . Loans are classified as follows Rio Tinto Aluminium Limited. This is an interest free loan of 137 million repayable in 2024. The loan is being amortised at an annual rate of 6.6 .

Provisions are measured at the present value of management s best estimate of the expenditure. The provision balance is subject to annual review. The value has been calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology and therefore subsequent measurement of the value of the provisions may vary from year to year due to changes in the underlying estimated costs, estimated indexation factors, discount rates at the reporting date and estimated cash flow timings. Changes in the rehabilitation provisions year on year are recognised in profit or loss in the reporting year in which the estimates change.  128 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 4 Departmental financial statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements 5.

Non corporate Commonwealth entities do not receive revenue appropriations for depreciation amortisation expenses. This expenditure is funded through equity either in Departmental Capital Budget or Equity appropriations when the cash payment for capital expenditure is required. As with the above practice, non corporate Commonwealth entities do not receive revenue appropriations for the depreciation expenses related to right of use leased assets. However, the lease liability principal repayment, which is a Statement of Financial Position item, is funded through the revenue appropriation.  138 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 4 Departmental financial statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements 6. People and Relationships This section describes a range of employment and post employment benefits provided to our people. 6.1. Employee Provisions 2023 2022 000 000 Note 6.1A Employee Provisions Leave 102,940 124,168 Separations and redundancies 361 1,282 Total employee provisions 103,301 125,450 Note 6.1B Administered Employee Provisions Leave 2,612 2,383 Total employee provisions 2,612 2,383 Accounting Policy Liabilities for short term employee benefits and termination benefits expected to be wholly settled within twelve months of the end of reporting period are measured at their nominal amounts. The nominal amount is calculated with regard to the rates expected to be paid on settlement of the liability. Leave The liability for employee benefits includes provisions for annual leave and long service leave. The leave liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will be applied at the time the leave is taken, including the department s employee superannuation contribution rates to the extent that leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The liability for long service leave has been determined by reference to the work of an actuary as at 30 June 2023 and management assessments relating to salary growth rates. The estimate of the present value of the liability takes into account attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. Separation and Redundancy The department recognises a provision for termination when it has developed a detailed formal plan for the terminations and has informed those employees affected that it will carry out the terminations. Superannuation The department s staff are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme CSS , the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme PSS , the PSS accumulation plan PSSap , the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust AGEST or other superannuation funds held outside the Australian Government. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap, AGEST and other non government superannuation funds are defined contribution schemes. The liability for the defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported in the Department of Finance s administered schedules and notes. The department makes employer contributions to the employees superannuation scheme at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Australian Government. The department accounts for the contributions as if they were contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June represents outstanding contributions.

Managing uncertainties This section analyses how the department manages financial risks within its operating environment. 7.1. Contingent assets and liabilities Note 7.1A Departmental Contingent Assets and Liabilities As at 30 June 2023, the department has no quantifiable departmental contingent assets or liabilities with a possible likelihood of progression 2022 nil . There are no unquantifiable or significant remote departmental contingent assets or liabilities 2022 nil . Note 7.1B Administered Contingent Assets and Liabilities Unquantifiable Administered Contingencies As at 30 June 2023, the department had the following unquantifiable administered contingencies detailed below. It is not possible to estimate the amounts of eventual payments that may be required in relation to these claims. Former British atomic test site at Maralinga The Australian Government is responsible for 14 unlimited indemnities relating to the Maralinga Rehabilitation Project 1995 2000 . In November 2009, the Australian Government agreed to the handback of the former nuclear test site Maralinga section 400 to the site s Traditional Owners, Maralinga Tjarutja. Under the terms of the Maralinga Nuclear Test Site Handback Deed, the Australian Government has indemnified the Maralinga Tjarutja people and the South Australian Government in respect of claims arising from test site contamination, and is preparing to undertake remediation works at the site to reduce hazards and risks. Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation indemnity On 21 April 2016, the then Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science signed a Deed of Indemnity between the Australian Government, Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ANSTO and ANSTO Nuclear Medicine Pty Ltd ANM , under which the Australian Government has formally agreed to indemnify ANSTO and ANSTO Officers, and ANM and ANM Officers, from any loss or liability arising from claims caused by ionising radiation. This deed will remain in place until April 2026. Ranger uranium mine rehabilitation The Australian Government approved the Ranger Uranium Mine in the late 1970s. ERA was authorised to mine uranium at Ranger until 2021, and is required to rehabilitate the site to achieve an environmental condition similar to adjacent areas. Pursuant to the Renegotiated Section 44 Agreement between the Australian Government and the Northern Land Council, the Australian Government has a responsibility to carry out rehabilitation works at Ranger should ERA fail to complete. The Government holds a rehabilitation security for this purpose, which is revalued periodically based on estimated rehabilitation costs at a point in time. At reporting date, the Government may not hold the full amount of security required to settle the estimated costs of rehabilitation. National Radioactive Waste Management Facility site selection process The Commonwealth, represented by the department was involved in legal proceedings before the Federal Court in relation to the National Radioactive Waste Management Facility site selection process. On 18 July 2023, the Federal Court handed down its decision in Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC Ors v Minister for Resources and Commonwealth of Australia SAD224 2021 . The Court set aside the former Minister s decision to declare the site for the facility.

Financial Instruments 2023 2022 000 000 Note 7.2A Categories of Financial Instruments Financial assets at amortised cost Cash and cash equivalents 10,965 26,420 Trade and other receivables 46,990 30,685 Accrued revenue 753 241 Total financial assets at amortised cost 58,708 57,346 Total financial assets 58,708 57,346 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Suppliers 63,153 68,557 Grants payable 5,800 Other payables 2,880 1,922 Total financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 66,033 76,279 Total financial liabilities 66,033 76,279 Note 7.2B Net Gains or Losses The net gains losses on financial instruments is immaterial. Accounting Policy Financial assets The department classifies its financial assets into the following categories a financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and b financial assets measured at amortised cost. The classification is based on both the department s business model for managing the financial assets and contractual cash flow characteristics at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised when the department becomes a party to the contract and, as a consequence, has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay cash and are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are transferred upon trade date. Financial Assets at Amortised Cost Financial assets included in this category are loans and receivables based on the following 1. the financial asset is held in order to collect the contractual cash flows and 2. the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest SPPI on the principal outstanding amount. Amortised cost is determined using the effective interest method. Effective Interest Method Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis for financial assets that are recognised at amortised cost. Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income FVOCI Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are administered investments held on behalf of the Australian Government for policy purposes. Impairment of Financial Assets The department uses an expected credit loss ECL model. Financial assets are assessed for impairment at the end of each reporting period based on the ECL model. Both loans and receivables are assessed for impairment at the end of each reporting period. The department has adopted the general approach to measure the impairment loss allowance for its administered loans. For trade and other receivables, the simplified approach has been adopted in measuring the impairment loss allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime ECL. A write off constitutes a derecognition event where the write off directly reduces the gross carrying amount of the financial asset. Financial liabilities Financial Liabilities at Amortised Cost The department classifies all its financial liabilities as measured at amortised cost, including recognising a provision for commitments to provide loans at concessional rates of interest. Liabilities are recognised to the extent that the goods or services have been received and irrespective of having been invoiced .  142 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 4 Departmental financial statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements 7.3.

The maximum exposure to credit risk arises from potential default of all debtors. The carrying amount of loans and trade receivables, net of impairment allowance, represents the department s maximum exposure to credit risk. The department has adopted the general approach prescribed under AASB 9 Financial Instruments to measure the expected credit losses ECLs for its administered loans. ECLs are based on an assessment of change in credit risk since initial recognition for each loan. If the credit risk on the loan has increased significantly since initial recognition then the impairment allowance is measured on the basis of lifetime ECLs. If the credit risk on the loan has not increased significantly since initial recognition then the impairment allowance is based on ECLs over the next 12 months. The department assesses the significant increase in credit risk for each loan by considering but not limited to the following information Information published in borrower annual statements Changes to borrower ratings by external credit rating agency Changes to borrower financial support from related entities or financial institutions Expected or potential breaches of loan covenants Expected delay in repayment Changes in general economic or market conditions For trade receivables, the simplified approach has been adopted in measuring the impairment loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. The department has measured the impairment allowance by applying expected default rates to the trade receivable ageing balances at the end of the reporting period. The expected default rates take into account both historical losses and forward looking information relating to trade receivables. Financial assets are considered to be credit impaired if one or more events that have a detrimental effect on the estimated future cash flows have already occurred. The department considers the following indicators to determine whether the asset is credit impaired or not at the reporting date Actual breach in making a loan repayment Granting of concession or repayment holiday to the debtor due to financial difficulty Likelihood that the debtor will enter bankruptcy In cases of non recovery of outstanding debts, the department records the write off event in accordance with its debt management policy in the financial statements. Note 7.3D Liquidity Risk The department s administered financial liabilities include grants and suppliers payable. The exposure to liquidity risk is based on the notion that the department will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with administered financial liabilities. This is highly unlikely due to appropriation funding mechanisms available to the department and internal policies and procedures to ensure appropriate resources exist to meet any financial obligations. Note 7.3E Market Risk The department s exposure to interest rate risk is primarily from its loans at amortised cost . Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. However, the effect on profit and loss is assessed as immaterial given the value of these financial instruments as at 30 June 2023.  144 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 4 Departmental financial statements Department of Industry, Science and Resources Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements 7.4. Fair Value Measurement The following tables provide an analysis of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. The remaining assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position do not apply the fair value hierarchy. The different levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below. Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at measurement date. Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Recurring and non recurring fair value measurements unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Accounting Policy The department s valuation methodologies for its non financial assets are provided by its independent valuer, which have been developed in accordance with AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement. The department tests the procedures of the valuation model as an internal management review at least once every 12 months with a formal valuation undertaken once every three years . If a particular asset class experiences significant and volatile changes in fair value i.e. where indicators suggest that the value of the class has changed materially since the previous reporting period , that class is subject to specific valuation in the reporting period, where practicable, regardless of timing of the last valuation.

Annual report 2022 23 171 Chapter 5 Departmental appendices Ecologically sustainable development and environmental performance This report is made under section 516A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 EPBC Act . We are committed to the 5 principles of ecologically sustainable development ESD integration precaution intergeneration biodiversity valuation. This is demonstrated in the way we develop and deliver policies, plans, programs, legislation, advice, and education and scientific services that reflect economic, environmental and social sustainability. Below are some examples of our commitment to the 5 principles of ESD in 2022 23. Advancing Rum Jungle and Maralinga rehabilitation projects We continue to work with the Northern Territory Government, Kungarakan and Warai Traditional Owners, and other stakeholders to prepare for rehabilitation works at Rum Jungle, subject to receipt of environmental approvals. We are also working with the South Australia Government and Maralinga Tjarutja Traditional Owners to remediate debris pits located throughout Maralinga that have eroded over time. Debris pits contain general waste for example, building rubble and scrap metal used in the British atomic testing program and subsequent rehabilitation projects. The Australian Government announced funding for the Maralinga Site Maintenance Project at the Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in 2021. How it accords with the principles of ESD The projects focus on rehabilitating sites previously disturbed by mining Rum Jungle and nuclear testing Maralinga . Rehabilitating these areas will improve biological diversity, promote environmental outcomes and cultural values, reduce health and safety risks, and allow current and future generations of Traditional Owners to use the land. How it furthers or advances ESD principles Rehabilitation activities improved the biodiversity and environmental conditions of the project areas. Planned future works will continue to improve project area conditions by positively impacting the environmental sustainability of the project areas and surrounding regions. Effective implementation of these projects will provide a blueprint for successful rehabilitation that can be implemented at other disturbed sites in the future.  172 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 5 Departmental appendices Supporting rehabilitation of Ranger Uranium Mine We continued to work with the Ranger Uranium Mine operator Energy Resources of Australia, the Northern Territory Government, the Northern Land Council, the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation and other stakeholders to support the mine operator s rehabilitation of the site. Restoration of the site to conditions that are similar to those of the surrounding Kakadu National Park will fulfil longstanding legal obligations. This includes extending the unique regulatory arrangements until rehabilitation has been completed. How it accords with the principles of ESD Ranger is subject to unique and site specific rehabilitation obligations that impose the highest standard of environmental protection. The land will be returned to its Traditional Owners once these obligations have been met. How it furthers or advances ESD principles Rehabilitation activities will continue to undergo comprehensive and periodic assessment by the Australian and Northern Territory governments, with input from Traditional Owners to ensure First Nations knowledge and practices are incorporated into Ranger s rehabilitation and closure. Supporting domestic end to end battery industries through the Australian Made Batteries Plan The Australian Made Batteries Plan supports domestic end to end battery industries, and recognises the economic and strategic importance of Australian made batteries in meeting our renewable energy targets. How it accords with the principles of ESD Batteries play a role in Australia achieving net zero emissions. Australian made batteries can help decarbonise industry, homes, vehicles, and communities. A diverse and sustainable end to end battery industry in Australia creates local jobs and boosts the national economy. Australian made batteries will leverage Australia s environmental, social and governance ESG credentials. These include relatively high levels of renewable energy usage, as well as safe and transparent labour practices. How it furthers or advances ESD principles The Australian Made Batteries Plan will advance ESD principles by fostering and growing a sustainable and thriving battery manufacturing ecosystem.

The 2009 Environment Regulations will be repealed when the 2023 Environment Regulations commence. This will preserve continuity of regulatory coverage. The 2023 Environment Regulations have been made without substantive policy change from the 2009 Environment Regulations. Minor technical amendments have been made to modernise the provisions and their language to align with current practice. These amendments include the restructuring and renumbering of provisions.  174 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 5 Departmental appendices NOPSEMA will administer the 2023 Environment Regulations. Under these regulations, persons who want to conduct a petroleum or greenhouse gas activity are required to prepare and implement a plan for the activity. The environment plan must set out the risks and impacts of the activity as well as the titleholder s proposed measures to manage and reduce the risks and impacts. A proposed petroleum or greenhouse gas activity cannot proceed unless NOPSEMA is satisfied that the impacts and risks to the environment will be reduced to levels that are acceptable and as low as reasonably practicable. How it accords with the principles of ESD The 2023 Environment Regulations will ensure that offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage titleholders are required to carry out offshore activities in a manner that is consistent with the principles of ESD. How it furthers or advances ESD principles The 2023 Environment Regulations will ensure that offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas activities are carried out in a manner that is consistent with the principles of ESD. Titleholders must identify, assess and reduce all environmental impacts and risks including socioeconomic risks linked to their activities to levels that are acceptable and as low as reasonably practicable. Administering the Research and Development Tax Incentive Under delegation from Industry Innovation and Science Australia, we administer the R DTI program. We do this by working with the Australian Taxation Office under a dual administration model. This offers a tax offset for companies conducting eligible R D activities that support a broad range of socioeconomic objectives across all industries. Businesses may register and claim for R D activities that improve the physical environment. These include improving pollution control, by identifying and analysing the sources and causes of pollutants, including their dispersal in the environment and the effects on humans, species fauna, flora and micro organisms and the biosphere developing monitoring facilities for measuring all types of pollution eliminating and preventing all forms of pollution in diverse environments. How it accords with the principles of ESD R DTI supports all businesses conducting eligible R D activities, including those directed towards the study and improvement of the physical environment, both pristine and degraded or altered conditions. How it furthers or advances ESD principles R DTI supports businesses conducting eligible R D activities, including those aimed at studying and improving pristine, degraded or altered physical environments.  Annual report 2022 23 175 Chapter 5 Departmental appendices Launching Questacon s QNetZero Project for carbon neutrality by 2030 Questacon s environmental policy expresses a commitment to minimising its impacts on the environment and promotes consideration of environmental issues in all decision making, planning and science communication activities.

Questacon s long term aim is to deliver services with net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It has established its emissions footprint and developed a short term emissions reduction plan. How it accords with the principles of ESD Questacon engages future generations in environmental science through its exhibitions and science, technology, engineering and mathematics program activities, and actively supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. How it furthers or advances ESD principles Questacon engages with communities, students and teachers, raising awareness of the importance of sustainability and promoting actions to lower everybody s carbon footprint. Supporting the National Measurement Institute environmental monitoring services The National Measurement Institute NMI provided specialised environmental analysis services to the Australian Government, regulators and industry to help meet environmental legislative requirements. NMI s definitive analytical results led to higher quality risk assessments and management of environmental issues for example, through ultra trace level testing for persistent organic pollutants, such as dioxins and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances . NMI also sought to maintain systems that reduce impacts on the environment for example, by providing support for the safe and effective operation of gas supply networks . NMI s accurate and trusted calibration of flowmeters helped network operators to minimise the risk of fugitive emissions from gas pipelines. How it accords with the principles of ESD Through NMI, we provide specialised environmental analysis services to the Australian Government, regulators and industry. How it furthers or advances ESD principles NMI s definitive analytical results lead to higher quality risk assessments and management of environmental issues.  176 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 5 Departmental appendices National Quantum Strategy The National Quantum Strategy articulates the Australian Government s ambition to become a leader in the global quantum technologies that are integral to a prosperous, fair and inclusive Australia by 2030. Quantum technologies could have transformative impacts on the global economy, and the National Quantum Strategy provides a framework to both promote technological advances that support Australia s ESD ambitions and support the domestic quantum industry to develop in a responsible manner. How it accords with the principles of ESD Action 5.1 of the National Quantum Strategy commits the Australian Government to working with industry, academia and states and territories to develop principles to support the responsible and inclusive development and use of quantum technologies. By implementing this action we can support quantum companies to consider the carbon footprint associated with energy intensive segments of their technology stack. Embedding good ESD practice into quantum technology development could help keep Australia s quantum sector competitive internationally. How it furthers or advances ESD principles Future applications in quantum technology may have major implications for reducing global emissions. Quantum could potentially enable advances in materials science, leading to improved industrial materials and battery technologies optimise transport and logistics networks, reducing carbon emissions from city traffic or port operations drive new discoveries in biotechnology to support the green economy improve sensing capabilities to support environmental monitoring and the agricultural sector. Theme 1 of the National Quantum Strategy encourages the development and adoption of quantum technologies through programs such as the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth and the Critical Technologies Challenge Program and highlights the role of quantum in optimising supply chains, improving public transport and reducing waste and emissions throughout the Australian economy. Critical minerals Implementation of the Critical Minerals Strategy 2023 2030 will help grow Australia s critical minerals industry and will underpin Australia s net zero ambitions. A key component of this work is to promote Australia as a world leader in ESG performance, and ensure that regulatory and policy frameworks set by the Australian Government are fit for purpose. This includes by applying the highest ESG standards and practices relevant to critical minerals to guide investment decisions and enable Australia to maintain its position as an ethical and sustainable producer of critical minerals.  Annual report 2022 23 177 Chapter 5 Departmental appendices How it accords with the principles of ESD Critical minerals are essential to manufacturing priority technologies that will contribute to emissions reduction for example, solar panels, electric vehicles, and wind turbines . Growing Australia s critical minerals industry can support Australia s climate change commitments and can help international partners achieve their emissions reduction targets. How it furthers or advances ESD principles Implementation of the strategy will allow Australia to apply the highest ESG standards and promote Australia as a leader in ESG performance. For example, by enabling fast, efficient and durable environmental approvals while upholding robust environmental protections embedding strong ESG practices that enable to access to global markets supporting the sector s enduring social license to operate fairly sharing the benefits of critical minerals development with communities, including First Nations Australians. Square Kilometre Array How it accords with the principles of ESD Construction of the Square Kilometre Array SKA Low radio telescope has been designed to minimise the impact on the environment. The SKA telescope is located on the traditional lands of the Wajarri Yamaji in the Mid West Region of Western Australia. Formerly a pastoral station, Boolardy, the land has been destocked and many parts are now regenerating with native vegetation. Wajarri Yamaji heritage and environmental protection at the SKA site is of critical importance. The department works with the Wajarri Yamaji and Western Australia regulatory bodies to ensure the protection and preservation of native vegetation and First Nations heritage. Monitoring of priority flora and fauna species is taking place to ensure their protection. Environmental protection and management obligations of the SKA project are outlined in the established Indigenous land use agreement ILUA with the Wajarri Yamaji. These matters are managed through the ILUA Liaison Committee, with representatives from all signatories, and commenced in 2023 for a period of 50 years. Through a cultural heritage management plan, the department and the Wajarri Yamaji work together to collaborate on protection of Wajarri Yamaji heritage. How it furthers or advances ESD principles Destocking and ongoing land management, including the preparation of a decommissioning plan that will return the site to its original state, will ensure the long term protection of the local environment. Internal operations environmental performance A report on the environmental performance of our internal operations can be found at  178 Annual report 2022 23 Chapter 5 Departmental appendices Appendix A4 Australian Public Service Net Zero 2030 reporting Australian Public Service APS Net Zero 2030 is the government s policy for the APS to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2030, and to transparently report on its emissions. As part of this, non corporate and corporate Commonwealth entities are required to report on their operational greenhouse gas emissions. The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory presents greenhouse gas emissions over the 2022 23 period. Results are presented on the basis of carbon dioxide equivalent CO2 e emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions reporting has been developed with methodology that is consistent with the whole of Australian Government approach as part of the APS Net Zero 2030 policy. Not all data sources were available at the time of the report and adjustments to baseline data may be required in future reports.

Scope 2 is indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling for own use. Scope 3 is all other indirect emissions, including from leased assets up and down stream. The electricity emissions reported in Table 26 are calculated using the location based approach. When applying the market based method, which accounts for activities such as GreenPower, purchased large scale generation certificates and or being located in the Australian Capital Territory, the total emissions for electricity, are in Table 27. The domestic flight emissions referenced in Table 26 and Table 27 were not reported in 2022 23. An estimated 7 kilotons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from domestic commercial flights are divided among the entities Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry DAFF , Department of Industry, Science and Resources DISR , Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts DITRDCA and DCCEEW. The exact allocation of domestic commercial flight emissions for each entity has not been determined yet due to machinery of government changes in the 2022 23 financial year. In future reports, the emissions data will be provided separately for each entity.
