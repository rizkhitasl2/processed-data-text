II Non legislative acts REGULATIONS COMMISSION REGULATION EU 2017 1485 of 2 August 2017 establishing a guideline on electricity transmission system operation Text with EEA relevance THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Regulation EC No 714 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross border exchanges in electricity and repealing Regulation EC No 1228 2003 1 , and in particular Article 18 3 d and Article 18 5 thereof, Whereas 1 A fully functioning and interconnected internal energy market is crucial for maintaining security of energy supply, increasing competitiveness and ensuring that all consumers can purchase energy at affordable prices. 2 Regulation EC No 714 2009 sets out non discriminatory rules governing access to the network for cross border exchanges in electricity with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market in electricity. 3 Harmonised rules on system operation for transmission system operators TSOs , distribution system operators DSOs and significant grid users SGUs should be set out in order to provide a clear legal framework for system operation, facilitate Union wide trade in electricity, ensure system security, ensure the availability and exchange of necessary data and information between TSOs and between TSOs and all other stakeholders, facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources, allow more efficient use of the network and increase competition for the benefit of consumers. 4 To ensure the operational security of the interconnected transmission system, it is essential to define a common set of minimum requirements for Union wide system operation, for the cross border cooperation between the TSOs and for utilising the relevant characteristics of the connected DSOs and SGUs. 5 All TSOs should comply with the common minimum requirements on procedures necessary to prepare real time operation, to develop individual and deliver common grid models, to facilitate the efficient and coordinated use of remedial actions which are necessary for real time operation in order to maintain the operational security, quality and stability of the interconnected transmission system, and to support the efficient functioning of the European internal electricity market and facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources RES . 6 While there are currently a number of voluntary regional cooperation initiatives in system operations promoted by TSOs, formalised coordination between TSOs is necessary for operating the Union transmission system in 25.8.2017 L 220 1 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 OJ L 211, 14.8.2009, p. 15.  order to address the transformation of the Union electricity market. The rules for system operation provided for in this Regulation require an institutional framework for enhanced coordination between TSOs, including the mandatory participation of TSOs in regional security coordinators RSCs . The common requirements for the establishment of RSCs and for their tasks set out in this Regulation constitute a first step towards further regional coordination and integration of system operation and should facilitate the achievement of the aims of Regulation EC No 714 2009 and ensure higher security of supply standards in the Union. 7 This Regulation should set out a framework for the mandated cooperation of TSOs via the appointment of RSCs. RSCs should issue recommendations to the TSOs of the capacity calculation region for which it is appointed. TSOs should, individually, decide whether to follow or not the recommendations of the RSC. The TSO should remain responsible for maintaining operational security of its control area. 8 Rules on operational training and certification are required in order to guarantee that system operator employees and other operational staff are skilled and well trained and that the system operator employees in real time operation are certified to operate the transmission system in a secure way during all operational situations. The rules on training and certification strengthen and formalise existing best practices amongst TSOs and ensure that minimum standards are applied by all TSOs in the Union. 9 Operational testing and monitoring requirements aim at ensuring the correct functioning of the elements of the transmission system, the distribution system and of the grid users equipment. Planning for and the coordination of operational tests are necessary to minimise disruptions in the stability, operation and economic efficiency of the interconnected system. 10 In view that planned outages impact grid stability also outside of a TSO s control area, each TSO should, within the scope of operational planning, monitor the feasibility of planned outages for each time frame and where necessary, coordinate outages with and between TSOs, DSOs and SGUs when those outages have an impact on cross border flows affecting the operational security of the transmission systems. 11 The operational and scheduling processes required to anticipate real time operational security difficulties and develop relevant remedial measures involve timely and adequate data exchange. Therefore, such exchange should not be hampered by any barriers between the different actors involved. 12 One of the most critical processes in ensuring operational security with a high level of reliability and quality is the load frequency control LFC . Effective LFC can be made possible only if there is an obligation for the TSOs and the reserve connecting DSOs to cooperate for the operation of the interconnected transmission systems as one entity and for providers power generating modules and providers demand facilities to meet the relevant minimum technical requirements. 13 The provisions on LFC and reserves, aim at setting out clear, objective and harmonised requirements for TSOs, reserve connecting DSOs, providers power generating modules and providers demand facilities in order to ensure system security and to contribute to non discrimination, effective competition and the efficient functioning of the internal electricity market. The provisions on LFC and reserves provide the technical framework necessary for the development of cross border balancing markets. 14 In order to ensure the quality of the common system frequency, it is essential that a common set of minimum requirements and principles for Union wide LFC and reserves are defined as a basis for both the cross border cooperation between the TSOs and, where relevant, for utilising characteristics of the connected generation, consumption and distribution systems. To that end, this Regulation addresses the LFC structure and operational rules, the quality criteria and targets, the reserve dimensioning, the reserve exchange, sharing and distribution and the monitoring related to LFC. 15 Synchronous areas do not stop at the Union s borders and can include the territory of third countries. The Union, Member States and TSOs should aim for secure system operation inside all synchronous areas across the Union. They should support third countries in applying similar rules to those contained in this Regulation. ENTSO for Electricity should facilitate cooperation between Union TSOs and third country TSOs concerning secure system operation. 25.8.2017 L 220 2 Official Journal of the European Union EN   16 In accordance with Article 8 of Regulation EC No 713 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 , the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators the Agency should take a decision if the competent regulatory authorities are not able to reach an agreement on common terms and conditions or methodologies. 17 This Regulation has been developed in close cooperation with the Agency, ENTSO for Electricity and stakeholders, in order to adopt effective, balanced and proportionate rules in a transparent and participative manner. In accordance with Article 18 3 of Regulation EC No 714 2009, the Commission will consult the Agency, ENTSO for Electricity and other relevant stakeholders before proposing any amendment to this Regulation. 18 The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 23 1 of Regulation EC No 714 2009, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION PART I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Subject matter For the purpose of safeguarding operational security, frequency quality and the efficient use of the interconnected system and resources, this Regulation lays down detailed guidelines on a requirements and principles concerning operational security b rules and responsibilities for the coordination and data exchange between TSOs, between TSOs and DSOs, and between TSOs or DSOs and SGUs, in operational planning and in close to real time operation c rules for training and certification of system operator employees d requirements on outage coordination e requirements for scheduling between the TSOs control areas and f rules aiming at the establishment of a Union framework for load frequency control and reserves.
