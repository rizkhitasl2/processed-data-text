I Legislative acts REGULATIONS REGULATION EU 2021 690 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 28 April 2021 establishing a programme for the internal market, competitiveness of enterprises, including small and medium sized enterprises, the area of plants, animals, food and feed, and European statistics Single Market Programme and repealing Regulations EU No 99 2013, EU No 1287 2013, EU No 254 2014 and EU No 652 2014 Text with EEA relevance THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43 2 , Article 114, Article 168 4 b and Articles 173 and 338 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 , Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 2 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 3 , Whereas 1 The internal market is a cornerstone of the Union. Since its inception, it has proved a major contributor to growth, competitiveness and employment and it should continue benefitting all citizens and businesses equally. It has generated new opportunities and economies of scale for Union businesses, notably micro, small and medium sized enterprises SMEs , and has strengthened their industrial competitiveness. The internal market has contributed to the creation of jobs and has offered greater choice of high quality products and services at lower prices for consumers. It continues to be an engine for building a more integrated market and a stronger, more balanced and fairer economy. It is one of the Union s major achievements and its best asset in an increasingly global world, as well as being a core element in achieving the green and digital transformation towards a sustainable economy, in response to the increasing pressures of climate change. 1 OJ C 62, 15.2.2019, p. 40. 2 OJ C 86, 7.3.2019, p. 259. 3 Position of the European Parliament of 12 February 2019 not yet published in the Official Journal and position of the Council at first reading of 13 April 2021 not yet published in the Official Journal . Position of the European Parliament of 27 April 2021 not yet published in the Official Journal . EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.5.2021 L 153 1   2 It is necessary for the internal market to adapt continuously to a rapidly changing environment of digital revolution and globalisation. The new era of digital innovation continues to provide opportunities for businesses and individuals, creates new products, services, processes and business models, and opportunities for the efficient production of high quality statistics. It equally constitutes a challenge to regulation, enforcement, consumer protection and safety. 3 A substantial body of Union law underpins the functioning of the internal market. It concerns, in particular, competitiveness, standardisation, mutual recognition, conformity assessment, consumer protection and market surveillance. It also consists of rules on business, trade and financial transactions, on the plant, animal, food and feed area, on the production of European statistics and on the promotion of fair competition. That substantial body of Union law provides for the level playing field that is essential for the functioning of the internal market for the benefit of consumers and businesses. 4 Nevertheless, discriminatory, unjustified or disproportionate barriers to the proper functioning of the internal market remain and new obstacles emerge. Adopting rules is only a first step and making them work is as important. Current challenges connected with the enforcement of existing rules, barriers to free movement of goods and services, and low levels of cross border public procurement limit the opportunities for businesses and consumers. Addressing such obstacles is ultimately a matter of citizens trust in the Union, as well as in its capacity to deliver and its ability to create jobs and growth while protecting the public interest. 5 Previously, there have been separate programmes for Union action in the fields of competitiveness of enterprises, especially SMEs, consumer protection, customers and end users in financial services, policymaking in financial services and in the plant, animal, food and feed area. Some additional activities have been financed directly under the internal market budget lines. It is now necessary to streamline and exploit synergies between various actions and provide for a more flexible, transparent, simplified and agile framework to finance activities aiming to achieve a well functioning sustainable internal market. Therefore, a new programme should be established bringing together activities financed previously under those other programmes and other relevant budget lines. That programme should also include new initiatives which aim to improve the functioning of the internal market, while avoiding duplication with related Union programmes and actions. 6 The development, production and dissemination of European statistics pursuant to Regulation EC No 223 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council 4 have been subject to a separate European Statistical Programme established by Regulation EU No 99 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 . In order to provide continuity of production and dissemination of European statistics, the new programme should also include activities covered by the previous European Statistical Programme by providing a framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics pursuant to Regulation EC No 223 2009. The new programme should establish the financial framework for European statistics to provide high quality, comparable and reliable European statistics, in order to underpin the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of all Union policies. Professional independence is a necessary prerequisite for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics. 7 It is therefore appropriate to establish a programme for improving the functioning of the internal market, the competitiveness and sustainability of enterprises, especially SMEs, standardisation, market surveillance and consumer protection, for the area of plants, animals, food and feed, and for European statistics Single Market Programme the Programme . The Programme should be established for a period of seven years to align its duration with that of the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 laid down in Council Regulation EU, Euratom 2020 2093 6 . 4 Regulation EC No 223 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics and repealing Regulation EC, Euratom No 1101 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities, Council Regulation EC No 322 97 on Community Statistics, and Council Decision 89 382 EEC, Euratom establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities OJ L 87, 31.3.2009, p. 164 . 5 Regulation EU No 99 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013 on the European statistical programme 2013 17 OJ L 39, 9.2.2013, p. 12 . 6 Council Regulation EU, Euratom 2020 2093 of 17 December 2020 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 OJ L 433 I, 22.12.2020, p. 11 . EN Official Journal of the European Union L 153 2 3.5.2021   8 The Programme should support the design, implementation and enforcement of Union legislation underpinning the proper functioning of the internal market. The Programme should support the creation of the right conditions to empower all actors of the internal market, including businesses, citizens, including consumers, and employees, representatives of civil society and public authorities. To that end, the Programme should aim to foster the competitiveness, capacity building and sustainability of enterprises, especially SMEs, including those operating in the tourism sector. The sustainability of enterprises is important to maintain their long term competitiveness and contributes to the transition to a more economically, environmentally and socially sustainable Union, which should go hand in hand with digitalisation and engagement in sustainable business practices. The Programme should also support the enforcement of consumer protection and safety rules. It should also raise the awareness of businesses and individuals of their rights by providing them with the right tools, appropriate information and assistance, to make informed decisions and strengthen their participation in Union policy making. Furthermore, the Programme should aim to enhance regulatory and administrative cooperation, notably through training programmes, the exchange of best practices and the building of knowledge and competence bases, including the use of strategic public procurement. The Programme should also aim to support the development of high quality Union and international standards and rule making, including through broad stakeholder involvement, which underpin the implementation of Union legislation. This should cover the field of financial reporting and audit, thereby contributing to the transparency and good functioning of the Union s capital markets and to the enhancement of investor protection. The objective of the Programme should also be to support the implementation and enforcement of Union legislation providing for a high level of health for humans, animals and plants, protection of the well being of people and the welfare of animals, food and feed safety whilst respecting the principles of sustainable development and ensuring a high level of consumer protection. Furthermore, the Programme should support the production of high quality European statistics in accordance with the statistical principles set out in Regulation EC No 223 2009 and further elaborated in the European Statistics Code of Practice. 9 A modern internal market that is based on principles of fairness, transparency and mutual trust promotes competition and benefits consumers, businesses and employees. Making better use of the ever evolving internal market in services should help Union businesses create jobs and grow across borders, offer a wider choice of services at better prices, and maintain high standards for consumers and workers. To achieve this, the Programme should contribute to the better monitoring of internal market developments, as well as to the identification and the removal of remaining discriminatory, unjustified or disproportionate barriers, and ensure that the regulatory framework can accommodate all forms of innovation, including new technological developments and processes, service innovation business models, collaborative and social economy models, social innovation and non technological innovation. 10 Regulatory obstacles in the internal market have been removed for many industrial products through prevention mechanisms, the adoption of common rules and, where no such Union rules exist, through the principle of mutual recognition. In areas where no Union legislation exists, the principle of mutual recognition applies, with the result that goods that are lawfully marketed in one Member State enjoy the right to free movement and can be sold in another Member State. Where the Member State concerned has grounds to oppose the marketing of the goods, it may impose a restriction, provided that such a restriction is non discriminatory, justified by legitimate public interest objectives, as set out in Article 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU , or recognised by the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union as an overriding reason of public interest, and proportionate to the aim pursued. The inadequate application of the principle of mutual recognition, consisting, for example, in imposing unjustified or disproportionate restrictions, makes it harder for companies to access markets in other Member States. Despite the high degree of market integration in the area of goods, that situation leads to lost opportunities for the economy at large. The adoption of Regulation EU 2019 515 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 , is expected to boost the economic benefits in this area. The Programme should therefore aim to improve the application of the principle of mutual recognition in the area of goods, realising 7 Regulation EU 2019 515 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2019 on the mutual recognition of goods lawfully marketed in another Member State and repealing Regulation EC No 764 2008 OJ L 91, 29.3.2019, p. 1 . EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.5.2021 L 153 3  its full potential. It should also aim to reduce the number of illegal and non compliant goods entering the market through targeted awareness raising and training, support for Product Contact Points referred to in Regulation EU 2019 515 and better cooperation among competent authorities for mutual recognition. 11 There are new regulatory and enforcement challenges relating to the rapidly changing environment of the digital revolution and concerning issues such as cybersecurity, data protection and privacy, internet of things or artificial intelligence and related ethical standards. Stringent rules on product safety and clarity with regard to liability are essential to ensure that Union citizens, including consumers, and businesses are able to benefit from appropriate protection in the event of damage. The Programme should therefore contribute to the rapid adaptation and better enforcement of a Union product liability regime which fosters innovation whilst ensuring the safety and security of users. 12 The placing on the market of products that are not compliant with Union law, including products imported from third countries, puts Union citizens, including consumers, as well as other end users, at risk. Economic operators selling compliant products by traditional or electronic means face distorted competition from those who do not comply with the rules due to lack of knowledge, intentionally in order to gain a competitive advantage or as a result of the fragmentation of market surveillance across the Union. Market surveillance authorities are often underfunded and constrained by national boundaries, while entrepreneurs trade at Union or even global level. In particular, in the case of e commerce, market surveillance authorities have great difficulties in tracing non compliant products imported from third countries in order to identify the responsible economic operators within their jurisdiction. They also have great difficulties in conducting risk assessments and tests due to the lack of physical access to products. The Programme should therefore seek to strengthen compliance of products by raising awareness of applicable Union product safety rules, by intensifying compliance checks in line with Regulation EU 2019 1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 and by promoting closer cross border cooperation among enforcement authorities. The Programme should also contribute to the consolidation of the existing framework for market surveillance activities, encourage joint actions of market surveillance authorities from different Member States, improve the exchange of information and promote convergence and closer integration of market surveillance activities. The Programme should do this in particular by ensuring that the new requirements introduced by Regulation EU 2019 1020 are strictly enforced so as to prevent the sale of non compliant products to consumers, as well as other end users. The Programme should therefore strengthen the capacity of market surveillance authorities across the Union, contribute to greater homogeneity in the enforcement of rules between Member States and enable Member States to benefit equally from the internal market in terms of economic growth and sustainability. 13 While the Programme does not include objectives and actions supporting the protection of intellectual property rights, it should nevertheless be borne in mind that often counterfeit products do not comply with the requirements set out in the Union legislation on product safety and consumer protection, and present risks to the health and safety of consumers, particularly when such products are purchased online. The Programme should therefore increase synergies with other Union programmes in the field of the protection of intellectual property rights programmes, in particular the Customs Control Equipment Instrument, established under a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Integrated Border Management Fund, the instrument for financial support for customs control equipment. 8 Regulation EU 2019 1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004 42 EC and Regulations EC No 765 2008 and EU No 305 2011 OJ L 169, 25.6.2019, p. 1 . EN Official Journal of the European Union L 153 4 3.5.2021   14 To facilitate the compliance of categories of harmonised products with higher inherent risk, the Union has put in place a system of accreditation for conformity assessment bodies, verifying their competence, impartiality and independence. It is essential that the conformity assessment bodies are reliable and competent, since they verify whether products meet the safety requirements before they are placed on the market. The main challenge now is to ensure that the accreditation system continues to represent the state of the art and that it is applied with the same stringency across the Union. The Programme should therefore support measures to ensure that conformity assessment bodies continue to fulfill their regulatory requirements, such as impartiality and independence, especially through the use of accreditation. Likewise, the Programme should also support measures to enhance the European accreditation system, in particular in new policy areas, by supporting the European cooperation for accreditation referred to in Regulation EC No 765 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 . 15 Since, with the development of online trade and travel services, consumer markets recognise no borders, it is important to ensure that consumers residing in the Union can benefit from the same high level of protection when goods and services are imported from economic operators based in third countries, including when they are sold online. It should therefore be possible for the Programme, where necessary, to support cooperation with relevant bodies located in third countries, for example, with regard to the exchange of information on non compliant products. 16 Public procurement is used by public authorities to ensure good value for the public money spent and to contribute to a more innovative, sustainable, inclusive and competitive internal market. This includes the application of evaluation criteria that not only identify the most economic advantageous offer, but also the most advantageous offer in terms of the greatest public value delivered when awarding tenders according to the best price quality ratio . Where this is in accordance with applicable Union law, environmental, fair trade and social aspects should be taken into account and a division of tenders into lots should be promoted for large infrastructure projects. Directives 2014 23 EU 10 , 2014 24 EU 11 and 2014 25 EU 12 of the European Parliament and of the Council provide the legal framework for the integration and effective functioning of the public procurement markets representing 14 of the Union s gross domestic product, for the benefit of public authorities, businesses and citizens, including consumers. Properly implemented public procurement rules are a crucial tool for strengthening the internal market and for boosting the growth of Union companies and Union jobs. The Programme should therefore support measures to ensure a wider uptake of strategic public procurement, the professionalisation of public buyers, the facilitation and improvement of access to procurement markets for SMEs, in particular through advisory services and training, an increase in transparency, integrity and better data, the boosting of the digital transformation of procurement and the promotion of joint procurement, through strengthening a partnership approach with the Member States, the improvement of data gathering and data analysis, including through the development of dedicated IT tools, as well as to ensure support for the exchange of experiences and good practices, the referencing of European and international standards, the provision of guidance, the pursuit of beneficial trade agreements, the strengthening of cooperation among national authorities and the launching of pilot projects. 17 In order to meet the objectives of the Programme and to facilitate the lives of citizens and businesses, increasingly digitalised and fully accessible, high quality, user centric public services need to be put in place. E administration and e government efforts also need to be boosted, while ensuring appropriate data protection and privacy. That implies that public administrations will need to engage in the co creation of those public services with citizens and businesses. Moreover, the continuous and steady increase of cross border activities in the internal market requires up to date, accurate and easy to understand information on the rights of businesses and citizens to be available. This means that simplified information explaining the administrative formalities should be displayed. In addition, providing legal advice and helping to solve problems which occur at a cross national level is essential. Furthermore, public authorities should be supported in their efforts to achieve those objectives, for example by connecting national administrations in a simple and efficient manner, as well as by providing information and facilitating an exchange of information explaining how the internal market works on the ground. The existing internal market 9 Regulation EC No 765 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing Regulation EEC No 339 93 OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30 . 10 Directive 2014 23 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the award of concession contracts OJ L 94, 28.3.2014, p. 1 . 11 Directive 2014 24 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004 18 EC OJ L 94, 28.3.2014, p. 65 . 12 Directive 2014 25 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and repealing Directive 2004 17 EC OJ L 94, 28.3.2014, p. 243 . EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.5.2021 L 153 5  governance tools already play an important role in that respect and their quality, visibility, transparency and reliability should be further enhanced. The Programme should therefore support the following, existing, internal market governance tools the Your Europe Portal which should become a backbone of the upcoming Single Digital Gateway, the Your Europe Advice, SOLVIT, the Internal Market Information System and the Single Market Scoreboard. 18 The Programme should support the development of the Union regulatory framework in the areas of company law and corporate governance, and contract law, with a view to making businesses, especially SMEs, more efficient and competitive, while providing protection for stakeholders affected by company operations, and with a view to reacting to emerging policy challenges. It should also ensure the appropriate evaluation, implementation and enforcement of the relevant acquis, inform and assist stakeholders and promote information exchange in the area. The Programme should further support the Commission s initiatives in support of a clear and well adapted legal framework for the data economy and innovation. Those initiatives are necessary to enhance legal certainty with regard to contractual and extra contractual obligations, in particular with regard to liability, security, ethics and privacy in the context of emerging technologies, such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence, robotics and 3D printing. The Programme should aim to stimulate the development of data driven business, as such business will be decisive for the performance of the Union economy in global competition. 19 The Programme should also promote the correct and full implementation and application by the Member States of the Union legal framework for anti money laundering and countering terrorism financing and the development of future policies to address new challenges in those fields. It should also support relevant activities of international organisations of European interest, such as the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism of the Council of Europe. 20 The objective of implementing and developing the internal market in the area of financial services, financial stability and the Capital Markets Union, including sustainable finance, is highly dependant on the evidence based policy measures taken by the Union. The Commission should play an active role in achieving that objective, by constantly monitoring financial markets and financial stability, assessing the implementation of Union legislation by Member States, evaluating whether the existing legislation is fit for purpose and, when new risks emerge, identifying potential areas of action, all with the continuous involvement of stakeholders, throughout the policy cycle. Such activities rely on the production of analyses, studies, training materials, surveys, conformity assessments, evaluations and high quality statistics and are supported by IT systems and communication tools. 21 The TFEU includes a system of rules ensuring that competition is not distorted in the internal market. The Programme should contribute to the Union s competition policy, including by improving and reinforcing the cooperation with networks, and with national authorities and courts, and by strengthening international cooperation, as well as by ensuring an outreach to a wider group of stakeholders in communicating and explaining the rights, benefits and obligations of the Union s competition policy. The Programme should also help to enhance the analysis and assessment of market developments, including through the use of sector inquiries and other market investigation tools, as well as by systematic sharing of information and best practices within the European Competition Network. This should contribute to fair competition and a level playing field, including at global level, and empower businesses, especially SMEs, and consumers to reap the benefits of the internal market. 22 The Programme needs, in particular, to tackle the radical implications for competition and the functioning of the internal market resulting from the ongoing green and digital transition of the economy and business environment, in particular through the exponential growth in the amount and use of data, taking account of the increasing recourse to artificial intelligence, big data algorithms and other IT tools and expertise by companies. It is also essential that the Programme supports networks and fosters a wider and deeper cooperation with Member States and their authorities and courts, since undistorted competition and the functioning of the internal market depend critically on action by those entities. In view of the particular role of competition policy in preventing harm to the EN Official Journal of the European Union L 153 6 3.5.2021  internal market resulting from anti competitive conduct beyond the Union s border, the Programme should also support cooperation with third country authorities, as appropriate. Finally, widening outreach activities is necessary in order to allow more citizens and businesses to reap the full benefits of fair competition in the internal market. This should support efforts to better demonstrate the benefits of the Union s competition policy to Union citizens, including through engagement with representatives of civil society groups and relevant stakeholders. Flexibility is expected to be needed in the implementation of the competition part of the Programme to respond to evolving needs that are affected by dynamic and rapid developments in the conditions of competition in the internal market the pace and magnitude of which are difficult to estimate. Those developments relate in particular to digitalisation, artificial intelligence, algorithms, big data, cybersecurity and forensic technology. 23 Strengthening the competitiveness and sustainability of Union enterprises while ensuring an effective level playing field and an open and competitive internal market is of the utmost importance. SMEs are the engine of the Union economy. They make up 99,8 of all businesses in the Union, provide two thirds of jobs, and contribute substantially to the creation of new quality jobs in all sectors with a regional and local dimension, and hence to the creation of social cohesion. SMEs are instrumental in the modernisation of industry and in the green and digital transformation of the economy, including the achievement of climate neutrality. The Programme should therefore support their efforts to increase resource efficiency and to develop environmentally friendly high quality products and services. In doing so, the Programme should also contribute to improve SMEs competitiveness on the global market. 24 SMEs share common challenges that do not affect larger firms to the same extent. Those common challenges include obtaining finance, recruiting a skilled work force, alleviating their administrative burden, taking up creativity and innovation, inter alia, through public procurement, and accessing global markets and value chains in order to develop their internationalisation activities. The Programme should address such market failures proportionally, while not unduly distorting competition in the internal market. The Programme should also take account of the particular needs of specific types of SMEs, such as micro enterprises, SMEs engaged in services and SMEs engaged in craft activities, as well as SMEs consisting of the self employed, members of the liberal professions and social economy enterprises. Social economy enterprises in the Union include different types of enterprises and entities falling within the social economy, such as cooperatives, mutual societies, non profit associations, foundations, social enterprises and other forms of enterprises. Since their primary focus is on creating shared value and social impact for people rather than on realising profits, they are able to act as an engine of social innovation, transparent governance and solidarity, by reinvesting the majority of their profits or surpluses in their objectives. Attention should also be paid to the particular needs of potential new entrepreneurs, such as young and female entrepreneurs, older people and persons with disabilities. 25 The Programme should take into account SMEs, as defined in Commission Recommendation 2003 361 EC 13 . When applying this Regulation in respect of SMEs, the Commission should consult all relevant stakeholders, including the public and private organisations representing SMEs and the Trade Promotion Organisations of the Member States. 26 The Programme should support and promote a culture of innovation, developing industrial ecosystems capable of encouraging business start ups and SME growth, focusing on all SMEs able to meet the challenges of the green and digital transition and of an increasingly competitive and fast moving environment. The Programme should seek to support the innovation uptake process by promoting new collaborative business models, networking and the sharing of knowledge and resources, including across European partnerships of clusters and business network organisations. 13 Commission Recommendation 2003 361 EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium sized enterprises OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36 . EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.5.2021 L 153 7   27 When establishing work programmes for providing support to SMEs, the strategic provisions of the SME strategy and the Small Business Act as well as the context in which SMEs operate, as described in the SME performance review, should be taken into account. Attention should also be paid to the SME Envoy Network. 28 Many of the Union s competitiveness problems involve SMEs difficulties in obtaining access to finance. Those difficulties arise because SMEs struggle to demonstrate their credit worthiness and have insufficient assets as security for lenders i.e. collateral guarantees , or because they lack awareness of the mechanisms to support their activities that already exist at Union, national or local level. Additional financing challenges arise from SMEs need to stay competitive by engaging, inter alia, in innovation uptake activities, digitalisation and internationalisation, as well as in the up and re skilling of their workforce. Limited access to finance has a negative effect on businesses creation, growth and survival rates, as well as on the readiness of new entrepreneurs to take over viable companies in the context of a business succession. 29 The lack of skills is a major obstacle to the growth of enterprise in the Union. To foster entrepreneurship in the Union and support the growth of SMEs and their digital and green transition, the Programme should promote and facilitate access to skills and mentoring schemes for SMEs, and in particular the development of technological, entrepreneurial and managerial skills. In doing so, the Commission should coordinate with initiatives undertaken in other Union, national and regional programmes to increase synergies and avoid duplication. 30 To overcome the market failures and to ensure that SMEs, including start ups and scale ups, continue to play their role as the foundation of the competitiveness of the Union s economy, SMEs need extra support in the form of debt and equity instruments established under the SME policy window of the InvestEU Fund established by Regulation EU 2021 523 of the European Parliament and of the Council 14 . The Loan Guarantee Facility, put in place under Regulation EU No 1287 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 15 , is of proven added value and is expected to make a positive contribution to at least 500 000 SMEs. More attention could be paid to increasing awareness, on the part of potential beneficiaries, of the availability of the InvestEU Programme for SMEs. 31 Actions under the Programme should seek to achieve its policy objectives not only through grants, but also through facilitating access to financial instruments and budgetary guarantees established under the SME policy window of the InvestEU Fund and should enhance synergies with other Union programmes. All actions should have clear Union added value. 32 The Programme should provide effective support for SMEs throughout their life cycle, providing assistance ranging from helping SMEs to find partners for joint projects to commercialisation and access to the market, capacity building and encouraging the cooperation along clusters and business network organisations. It should also support the green and digital transition of SMEs and build on the unique knowledge and expertise developed with regard to SMEs, as well as on long experience working with Union, national and regional stakeholders. That support should build on the experience of the Enterprise Europe Network EEN as a one stop shop to improve the competitiveness of SMEs and to develop their business in the internal market and beyond. The EEN continues to deliver services on behalf of other Union programmes, notably Horizon Europe established by Regulation EU 2021 695 of the European Parliament and of the Council 16 , using the financial resources of those programmes. The EEN should also facilitate enhanced participation of SMEs in the development of internal market policy initiatives, such as public procurement and standardisation processes. The EEN should improve cooperation with European Digital Innovation Hubs under the Digital Europe Programme established by Regulation EU 2021 694 of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 and the InvestEU Advisory Hub. In addition, the successful mentoring scheme Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs should remain the tool to enable new or aspiring entrepreneurs to gain business and managerial experience by being matched with and by learning from an 14 Regulation EU 2021 523 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 March 2021 establishing the InvestEU Programme and amending Regulation EU 2015 1017 OJ L 107, 26.3.2021, p. 30 . 15 Regulation EU No 1287 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing a Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and small and medium sized enterprises COSME 2014 2020 and repealing Decision No 1639 2006 EC OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 33 . 16 Regulation EU 2021 695 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 April 2021 establishing Horizon Europe the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for participation and dissemination, and repealing Regulations EU No 1290 2013 and EU No 1291 2013 OJ L , 12.5.2021 . 17 Regulation EU 2021 694 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2021 establishing the Digital Europe Programme and repealing Decision EU 2015 2240 OJ L , 11.5.2021 .

The Programme should extend its geographical coverage and offer a wider range of matching possibilities to entrepreneurs in complementarity with other Union initiatives where relevant. 33 Additional efforts should be made to reduce the administrative burden and to make the initiatives of the Programme more accessible by reducing the costs to SMEs of complicated application processes and participation requirements. In that context, the EEN should be the main information point for SMEs interested in accessing Union funds, functioning as a one stop shop , and providing them with tailored guidance. It is important to build on the experiences of the existing measures supporting SMEs, whilst remaining open to adapting them in the light of the changing conditions for SMEs in the internal market, especially those regarding digitalisation and the regulatory burden. 34 Since clusters offer favourable and resilient business environments, they are a strategic tool for supporting the competitiveness and scaling up of SMEs. They can facilitate the green and digital transition of industry, including services, and strengthen the economic development of regions through the creation of growth and jobs. It is important that Joint Cluster Initiatives achieve critical mass since this will accelerate the growth of SMEs. By connecting specialised industrial eco systems, clusters create new business opportunities for SMEs and integrate them better in Union and global strategic value chains. Support should be provided for the development of transnational and interregional partnership strategies and the implementation of joint activities, supported by the European Cluster Collaboration Platform and its European Resource Efficiency Knowledge Centre. Support should also include helping SMEs to team up with SMEs from third countries. Sustainable partnering should be encouraged by providing continuation funding if performance and participation milestones are reached. Direct support to SMEs should be channelled through cluster organisations for the following promoting the uptake of advanced technologies, new business models, low carbon and resource efficient solutions, creativity and design, the upgrading of skills, the attraction of talent, the acceleration of entrepreneurship, and internationalisation. Other specialised SME support actors should be associated with that direct support to SMEs in order to facilitate industrial transformation and the implementation of smart specialisation strategies. The Programme should therefore contribute to and build links with the Union s innovation hubs, in particular its digital innovation hubs, and investments made under Cohesion Policy and Horizon Europe. Synergies with the Erasmus programme established by Regulation EU XXXX XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council 18 could also be explored. 35 The Programme should help to strengthen the relationship between businesses, especially SMEs, and universities, research centres and other institutions involved in knowledge creation and dissemination. This relationship could help to improve the ability of businesses to tackle the strategic challenges posed by the new international context. 36 SMEs, owing to their smaller size, face specific obstacles to growth. It is particularly difficult for them to grow and scale up some of their business activities. Based on the success of, and the lessons learned, and experiences from the SME Instrument and the Union cluster projects for new industrial value chains under Horizon 2020, established by Regulation EU No 1291 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 19 , the Programme should provide support for scaling up activities by SMEs at all crucial stages in their development, including support for internatio nalisation, the uptake of innovation and commercialisation activities. That support would complement support from the European Innovation Council under Horizon Europe, which will mainly focus on breakthrough and disruptive innovation, and therefore on innovative SMEs, targeting especially market creating innovation, while also supporting all types of innovation, including incremental innovation. 18 Regulation EU XXXX XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council of XXX establishing Erasmus the Union Programme for education and training, youth and sport and repealing Regulation EU No 1288 2013 not yet published in the Official Journal . 19 Regulation EU No 1291 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing Horizon 2020 the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014 2020 and repealing Decision No 1982 2006 EC OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 104 . EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.5.2021 L 153 9   37 Creativity and all forms of innovation, including innovation in pursuit of enhanced resource and energy efficiency, are crucial for the competitiveness of the Union s industrial value chains. They represent catalysts for the modernisation of the business and industry sectors and contribute to smart, inclusive sustainable growth. However, uptake by SMEs is still lagging behind. The Programme should therefore support targeted actions, networks and partnerships for creativity driven innovation to enable SMEs to master the green and digital transition throughout the industrial value chains and ecosystems. 38 European standards play an important role in the internal market. They are of vital interest for the competitiveness of undertakings and especially SMEs. European standards are also a crucial tool for supporting Union legislation and policies in a number of key areas that aim to foster the green and digital transition, such as energy, climate change and environmental protection, information and communication technology, sustainable use and recycling of resources, innovation, product safety, consumer protection, worker s safety and working conditions and ageing population, thereby positively contributing to the society as a whole. In order to maximise their contribution, experience has shown that the speed and timeliness of the elaboration of standards need to be improved and more effort needs to be made to better involve all relevant stakeholders, including those representing consumers. 39 European standardisation activities are governed by Regulation EU No 1025 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council 20 and implemented through a long standing public private partnership that is fundamental to achieving the objectives set in that Regulation, as well as those contained in general and sectorial Union standardisation policies. 40 A well functioning common financial and non financial reporting framework is essential for the internal market, for the effective functioning of the financial markets and for the realisation of the integrated market for financial services in the context of the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union. 41 In accordance with Regulation EC No 1606 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council 21 , International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board and related interpretations from the IFRS Interpretations Committee are to be incorporated into Union law in order to be applied by companies with securities listed on a regulated market in the Union only if IFRS meet the requirements set out in that Regulation, including the requirement that accounts give a true and fair view as provided for in Directive 2013 34 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 22 and that they are conducive to the European public good. Such international accounting standards need to be developed in a transparent and democratically accountable way. IFRS therefore play a major role in the functioning of the internal market and the Union therefore has a direct interest in ensuring that the process by which IFRS are developed and approved results in standards that are consistent with the requirements of the legal framework of the internal market. It is therefore important to establish in the Programme appropriate funding arrangements for the IFRS Foundation. 42 Taking into account the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group s EFRAG role in assessing whether IFRS comply with the requirement of Union law and policy, as laid down in Regulation EC No 1606 2002, it is also necessary for the Union to ensure that the funding of EFRAG is stable and therefore to contribute to that funding via the Programme. The technical work of EFRAG should focus on providing the Commission with technical advice on the endorsement of IFRS as well as on the appropriate level of Union participation in the process of developing those IFRS, and should ensure that the interests of the Union are adequately taken into account in the international standard setting process. Those interests should include the notion of prudence , the maintenance of the requirement of a true and fair view , as laid down in Directive 2013 34 EU, and of the European public good, as laid down in Regulation EC No 1606 2002, taking into account the impact of IFRS on financial stability and the 20 Regulation EU No 1025 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation, amending Council Directives 89 686 EEC and 93 15 EEC and Directives 94 9 EC, 94 25 EC, 95 16 EC, 97 23 EC, 98 34 EC, 2004 22 EC, 2007 23 EC, 2009 23 EC and 2009 105 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87 95 EEC and Decision No 1673 2006 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council OJ L 316, 14.11.2012, p. 12 . 21 Regulation EC No 1606 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards OJ L 243, 11.9.2002, p. 1 . 22 Directive 2013 34 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006 43 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78 660 EEC and 83 349 EEC OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19 . EN Official Journal of the European Union L 153 10 3.5.2021  economy. The European Corporate Reporting Lab has been established as part of EFRAG, to promote innovation and the development of best practices in corporate reporting. It provides a forum in which companies and investors can share best practices, notably in the field of non financial and sustainability reporting. Building on this work, EFRAG should also contribute to the development of non financial reporting standards. 43 In the field of statutory audit, the Public Interest Oversight Board PIOB was created in 2005 by the Monitoring Group, an international organisation responsible for monitoring the governance reform of the International Federation of Accountants IFAC . The role of the PIOB is to oversee the process leading to the adoption of International Standards on Auditing ISAs and other public interest activities of the IFAC. It is possible for ISAs to be adopted for application in the Union provided, in particular, that they have been developed in accordance with due process, public oversight and transparency, as required under Article 26 of Directive 2006 43 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 23 . Considering the introduction of ISAs in the Union and the key role of the PIOB in ensuring that they fulfil the requirements laid down in Directive 2006 43 EC, it is therefore important to establish in the Programme appropriate funding arrangements for the PIOB. 44 The Union contributes to ensuring a high level of consumer protection, empowering consumers and putting them at the heart of the internal market by supporting and complementing Member States policies in seeking to ensure that citizens when acting as consumers can fully reap the benefits of the internal market and that, in so doing, their safety and legal and economic interests are properly protected by means of concrete actions. It is also necessary for the Union to ensure that consumer and product safety laws are properly and equally enforced on the ground and that businesses enjoy a level playing field and therefore that competition in the internal market is fair. Moreover, it is necessary to empower, encourage and assist consumers to make sustainable and informed choices, thus contributing to a sustainable, energy and resource efficient and circular economy. 45 The Programme should aim to raise awareness, on the part of consumers, businesses, representatives of civil society and authorities, of Union consumer and safety laws. It should also empower consumers and their representative organisations at national level and at Union level. It should do this in particular by supporting the European consumer organisation BEUC Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs , which is a long established and well recognised non governmental organisation representing the interests of consumers in relation to all relevant Union policies, which has enabled that organisation to build enhanced synergies to strengthen consumer advocacy. It also should do that in particular by supporting the European Association for the Coordination of Consumer Representation in Standardisation ANEC , which represents consumers interest in relation to standardisation issues. In doing so, particular attention should be paid to new market needs regarding the promotion of sustainable consumption by targeting in particular actions combatting those planned obsolescence practices that are misleading and other misleading practices such as false environmental claims, by informing consumers better about product durability and reparability. Particular attention should also be paid to preventing the vulnerabilities and to meeting the challenges created by the digitalisation of the economy, in relation to, for example, connected products, the internet of things, artificial intelligence and the use of algorithms, and the development of new consumption patterns and business models. The Programme should support actions for the development of relevant information on markets, including the publication of the Union consumer scoreboards. 46 The Programme should support national competent authorities, including those responsible for monitoring product safety, which cooperate notably via the Union s rapid alert system for dangerous products. It should also support the enforcement of Directive 2001 95 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 24 and Regulation EC No 765 2008 regarding consumer protection and product safety, and the Consumer Protection Cooperation 23 Directive 2006 43 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, amending Council Directives 78 660 EEC and 83 349 EEC and repealing Council Directive 84 253 EEC OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87 . 24 Directive 2001 95 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety OJ L 11, 15.1.2002, p. 4 . EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.5.2021 L 153 11  Network and international cooperation between the relevant authorities in third countries and in the Union. The Programme should also aim to ensure access for all consumers and traders to quality out of court dispute resolution, online dispute resolution and information on the process for participating in actions seeking redress. 47 The Programme should also support the European Consumer Centres Network, which assists consumers to obtain the benefit of their Union consumer rights when they purchase goods and services cross border in the internal market and European Economic Area, either on line or when travelling. The network, which is 29 centres strong and which has been jointly funded by the Union consumer programmes for more than 15 years, has proven its added value in relation to strengthening consumers and traders trust in the internal market. It deals with more than 120 000 consumers requests per year and reaches millions of citizens via its press and online information activities. It is one of the most valued citizens assistance networks in the Union and most of its centres host contact points offering advice on aspects of internal market law, such as the Directive 2006 123 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 25 . Evaluations have stressed the importance of the centres continuing their operations. The European Consumer Centres Network can also be an important source of information about challenges and problems that consumers encounter at local level, which are relevant for Union policy making and for the protection of consumers interests. There are also plans for the network to develop reciprocity arrangements with similar bodies in third countries. 48 Directives 98 6 EC 26 , 2005 29 EC 27 , 2011 83 EU 28 , EU 2019 2161 29 and EU 2020 1828 30 of the European Parliament and of the Council have been adopted to ensure, inter alia, the equal treatment of consumers across the internal market in relation to cross border issues, such as sales of non compliant products in the motor vehicles sector, dual quality standards for products, or the problems experienced by passengers in the event of flight cancellations or long flight delays. They also aim to strengthen the enforcement capacities of Member States, enhance product safety and increase international cooperation and new possibilities for redress notably through representative actions by qualified entities. In May 2017, the Commission carried out a fitness check of Union consumer and marketing law, which exposed the need to better enforce rules and facilitate redress when consumers have been harmed by breaches to consumer laws. In view of that fitness check, supporting the full implementation of those Directives and actions and promoting their cross border enforcement should therefore be a priority. 49 Citizens are particularly affected by the functioning of financial markets and should, therefore, be further informed about relevant rights, risks and benefits. Financial markets are a key component of the internal market and require a solid framework for regulation and supervision that ensures not only financial stability and a sustainable economy, but also provides a high level of protection to consumers and other financial services end users, including retail investors, savers, insurance policyholders, pension fund members and beneficiaries, individual shareholders, 25 Directive 2006 123 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market OJ L 376, 27.12.2006, p. 36 . 26 Directive 98 6 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers OJ L 80, 18.3.1998, p. 27 . 27 Directive 2005 29 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business to consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84 450 EEC, Directives 97 7 EC, 98 27 EC and 2002 65 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation EC No 2006 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council Unfair Commercial Practices Directive OJ L 149, 11.6.2005, p. 22 . 28 Directive 2011 83 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights, amending Council Directive 93 13 EEC and Directive 1999 44 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 85 577 EEC and Directive 97 7 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council OJ L 304, 22.11.2011, p. 64 . 29 Directive EU 2019 2161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 amending Council Directive 93 13 EEC and Directives 98 6 EC, 2005 29 EC and 2011 83 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer protection rules OJ L 328, 18.12.2019, p. 7 . 30 Directive EU 2020 1828 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2020 on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers and repealing Directive 2009 22 EC OJ L 409, 4.12.2020, p. 1 . EN Official Journal of the European Union L 153 12 3.5.2021  borrowers and SMEs. The Programme should contribute to enhancing the capacity of consumers and other financial services end users to participate in policymaking, including through the production and dissemination of clear, complete and user friendly information about products provided in the financial markets. 50 The Programme should therefore continue to support the specific activities covered by the 2017 2020 Capacity Building Programme enhancing the involvement of consumers and other financial services end users in Union policy making, as set out in Regulation EU 2017 826 of the European Parliament and of the Council 31 , which continued the pilot project and preparatory action of the years 2012 2017. This is necessary in order to ensure that policy makers are aware of the views of stakeholders other than financial sector professionals and to ensure a better representation of the interests of consumers and other financial services end users. The Programme should continuously develop its methodology and best practices on how to increase the engagement of consumers and financial services end users in order to identify issues relevant for Union policy making and ensure that the interests of consumers in the area of financial services are protected. This should improve financial services policies, especially those that aim to foster better public understanding of the issues at stake in financial regulation and enhanced financial literacy. 51 In the context of the pilot project and preparatory action of the years 2012 2017, the Commission awarded grants to two organisations following an annual open call for proposals. The two organisations are Finance Watch, set up with Union grants in 2011 as an international non profit association under Belgian law, and Better Finance, which is the outcome of successive re organisations and rebrandings of pre existing European federations of investors and shareholders since 2009. The Capacity Building Programme established under Regulation EU 2017 826, identifies those same two organisations as sole beneficiaries. It is therefore necessary to continue to co finance those organisations in the context of the Programme. However, this financing should be subject to a thorough evaluation of the effectiveness and impact achieved towards fulfilling the objectives pursued. In this respect, if other potential beneficiaries emerge that have among their primary objectives and activities representing the interests of consumers and end users at Union level, and that have, through their membership, a broad geographical coverage and range of interests, a call for applicants proposals should be open to them. 52 A high level of health protection in the area of plants, animals, food and feed is necessary to protect consumers as well as to allow the internal market to operate efficiently. A safe and sustainable food supply chain is a prerequisite for society and the internal market to function. Preventing cross border health crises and food scares is of the utmost importance, since they disrupt the functioning of the internal market by limiting the movements of persons and goods and disrupting production and consumption. Therefore, the Programme should support concrete actions, such as establishing emergency measures in the event of crisis situations affecting animal and plant health. 53 The general objective of Union law in the area of plants, animals, food and feed is to safeguard a high level of health for humans, animals and plants along the food chain, to support the improvement of the welfare of animals, to contribute to a high level of protection and information for consumers and a high level of protection of the environment, including for the preservation of biodiversity and taking into account situations caused by potential climate change impacts in the Member States, while improving the sustainability of food and feed production and contributing to food security and affordable prices, cutting food waste, increasing the quality standards of products across the Union, and enhancing the competitiveness of the Union food and feed industry and the creation of jobs, including by stimulating research and innovation. 31 Regulation EU 2017 826 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2017 on establishing a Union programme to support specific activities enhancing the involvement of consumers and other financial services end users in Union policy making in the area of financial services for the period of 2017 2020 OJ L 129, 19.5.2017, p. 17 . EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.5.2021 L 153 13   54 In view of the specific nature of the actions concerning a high level of health for humans, animals and plants, special eligibility criteria concerning provision of grants and use of public procurement need to be laid down in this Regulation. In particular, by way of exception to the principle of non retroactivity in Regulation EU, Euratom 2018 1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council 32 the Financial Regulation , the costs for the emergency measures, due to their urgent and unforeseeable nature, should be eligible, including costs incurred as a result of a suspected occurrence of a disease or pest, provided that the occurrence is subsequently confirmed and notified to the Commission. The corresponding budgetary commitments and the payment of eligible expenditure should be made by the Commission, after signature of the legal commitments and after assessment of the payment applications submitted by the Member States. Costs should also be eligible for surveillance, prevention and protection measures taken in the case of a direct threat to the health status of the Union as a result of the occurrence or development, in the territory of a third country, a Member State or its overseas countries and territories, of certain animal diseases and zoonoses as well as for protection measures taken or other relevant activities carried out in support of the health status of plants in the Union. 55 In view of the increasing globalisation of the plant, animal, food and feed area, official controls carried out by the Member States are an essential tool for verifying and monitoring that relevant Union requirements are being implemented, complied with and enforced, including in respect of imports. The effectiveness and efficiency of official control systems is vital for maintaining a high level of safety along the food chain, as well as consumer confidence, whilst ensuring a high level of protection of the environment and of animal welfare. Union financial support should be made available for such control measures. In particular, a financial contribution should be available to European Union reference laboratories in order to help them bear the costs arising from the implementation of work programmes approved by the Commission, and may be available to national plant and animal health reference laboratories, which according to Regulation EU 2017 625 of the European Parliament and of the Council 33 are to benefit from adequate financial resources provided by Member States, on condition that it can be clearly shown that the actions carried out represent Union added value and that sufficient funding is available under the Programme to support those actions. Moreover, since the effectiveness of official controls also depends on the availability to the control authorities of well trained staff with an appropriate knowledge of Union law, the Union should be able to contribute to their training and relevant exchange programmes organised by competent authorities. 56 Anti microbial resistance is a growing health problem in the Union and worldwide. Therefore, it should be possible to co finance measures to support the fight against anti microbial resistance under the Programme. 57 High quality European statistics developed, produced and disseminated under the Programme pursuant to Regulation EC No 223 2009 are essential for evidence based decision making. European statistics should be available in a timely manner and should contribute to the implementation of Union policies referred to in TFEU, notably strengthened and integrated economic governance, social, economic and territorial cohesion, sustainable development, agricultural policy, the social dimension of Europe and globalisation. 32 Regulation EU, Euratom 2018 1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, amending Regulations EU No 1296 2013, EU No 1301 2013, EU No 1303 2013, EU No 1304 2013, EU No 1309 2013, EU No 1316 2013, EU No 223 2014, EU No 283 2014, and Decision No 541 2014 EU and repealing Regulation EU, Euratom No 966 2012 OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1 . 33 Regulation EU 2017 625 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2017 on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products, amending Regulations EC No 999 2001, EC No 396 2005, EC No 1069 2009, EC No 1107 2009, EU No 1151 2012, EU No 652 2014, EU 2016 429 and EU 2016 2031 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Regulations EC No 1 2005 and EC No 1099 2009 and Council Directives 98 58 EC, 1999 74 EC, 2007 43 EC, 2008 119 EC and 2008 120 EC, and repealing Regulations EC No 854 2004 and EC No 882 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 89 608 EEC, 89 662 EEC, 90 425 EEC, 91 496 EEC, 96 23 EC, 96 93 EC and 97 78 EC and Council Decision 92 438 EEC Official Controls Regulation OJ L 95, 7.4.2017, p. 1 . EN Official Journal of the European Union L 153 14 3.5.2021   58 European statistics are indispensable for Union decision making and for measuring the performance and impact of Union initiatives. Therefore, it is important to ensure the continued provision and development of European statistics, taking a Union wide approach and going beyond an internal market perspective in order to cover all Union activities and policy areas, including empowering businesses and citizens to take informed decisions. 59 In view of its horizontal character, the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics within the meaning of Regulation EC No 223 2009 is subject to specific requirements, and in particular those laid down in that Regulation, with regard to respect for statistical principles, as well as the functioning of the European Statistical System and its governance, including the role and tasks assigned to the European Statistical System Committee and to the Commission Eurostat , the establishment and implementation of the programming of the statistical activities. 60 The draft part of the Programme regarding the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics has been submitted for prior examination to the European Statistical System Committee in accordance with Regulation EC No 223 2009. 61 The Union and Member States are committed to being frontrunners in implementing the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. By contributing to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, the Union and Member States will foster a stronger, more sustainable, inclusive, secure and prosperous Europe. The Programme should contribute to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, including by balancing the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, and, to that end, giving a clear and visible commitment to the mainstreaming of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 62 Reflecting the importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union s commitments to implement the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this Programme is intended to contribute to mainstreaming climate actions and to the achievement of the overall target of 30 of Union budget expenditure supporting climate objectives. Relevant actions will be identified during the Programme s preparation and implementation, and reassessed in the context of the relevant evaluations and review processes. In this context the Programme should support activities that respect the climate and environmental standards and priorities of the Union, and would do no significant harm to environmental objectives within the meaning of Regulation EU 2020 852 of the European Parliament and of the Council 34 . 63 This Regulation lays down a financial envelope for the Programme which is to constitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of point 18 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 16 December 2020 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources 35 , for the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure. 64 The Agreement on the European Economic Area 36 provides for cooperation in the fields subject to the Programme between the Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and the countries of the European Free Trade Association participating in the European Economic Area EEA , on the other. It should also be possible to open the Programme to participation by acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates, European Neighbourhood Policy countries and other third countries. In addition, in the field of European statistics, the Programme should be open to Switzerland in accordance with the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on cooperation in the field of statistics 37 . 34 Regulation EU 2020 852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation EU 2019 2088 OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13 . 35 OJ L 433 I, 22.12.2020, p. 28. 36 OJ L 1, 3.1.1994, p. 3. 37 OJ L 90, 28.3.2006, p. 2. EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.5.2021 L 153 15   65 Third countries which are members of the EEA may participate in Union programmes in the framework of the cooperation established under the Agreement on the European Economic Area, which provides for the implementation of the programmes on the basis of a decision under that Agreement. Third countries may also participate on the basis of other legal instruments. A specific provision should be introduced in this Regulation requiring third countries to grant the necessary rights and access required for the authorising officer responsible, the European Anti Fraud Office OLAF and the Court of Auditors to comprehensively exercise their respective competences. 66 The Financial Regulation applies to this Programme. The Financial Regulation lays down rules on the implementation of the Union budget, including rules on grants, prizes, procurement, indirect management, financial instruments, budgetary guarantees, financial assistance and the reimbursement of external experts. 67 The actions implemented under the predecessor programmes and budget lines have proven to be adequate and should be retained. The new actions introduced under the Programme aim in particular to reinforce the well functioning internal market. In order to provide more simplicity and flexibility in the execution of the Programme and thereby to better deliver on its objectives, the actions should be defined only in terms of overall, generic categories. Lists of indicative activities concerning specific objectives in the areas of competitiveness and consumer protection, or specific activities stemming from regulatory requirements, such as specific activities in the areas of standardisation, market surveillance, the plant, animal, food and feed area and European statistics should also be included in the Programme. 68 It is necessary to specify certain categories of entities eligible for funding as well as those entities which should be eligible for funding without a call for proposals. 69 Considering the increasing interconnectivity and digitalisation of the global economy, the Programme should continue to offer the possibility of involving external experts, such as officials of third countries, representatives of international organisations or economic operators in certain activities. 70 It is necessary to indicate specific criteria concerning co financing rules and eligible costs. Since, for some of the specific objectives, it might be necessary to finance eligible costs in full, it should be possible to derogate from Article 190 of the Financial Regulation. 71 Pursuant to Article 193 2 , second subparagraph, point a of the Financial Regulation, a grant may be awarded for an action which has already begun, provided that the applicant can demonstrate the need for starting the action prior to signature of the grant agreement. While in such cases the costs incurred prior to the date of submission of the grant application would in principle not be eligible, this should exceptionally be possible taking into account the delayed entry into force of this Programme and in order to avoid any disruption in Union support, which could be prejudicial to the Union s interests. Therefore, where this is necessary to ensure continuity and during a limited period of time at the beginning of the multi annual financial framework 2021 2027, costs in respect of an action which has already begun should be eligible from 1 January 2021, even if those costs were incurred prior to the date of submission of the grant application. For the same reasons and under the same conditions and as a derogation from Article 193 4 of the Financial Regulation the costs incurred prior to the date of submission of the grant application should be eligible in the case of operating grants. 72 In line with the Commission s commitment, set out in its Communication of 19 October 2010 entitled The EU Budget Review , and in order to provide for coherence and simplification of funding programmes, resources should be shared with other Union funding instruments if the envisaged actions under the Programme pursue objectives which are common to various funding instruments, excluding however double financing. 73 The Programme should contribute to the overall support addressing specific needs of outermost regions and their integration in the internal market, as recently reconfirmed in the Commission s Communication A stronger and renewed strategic partnership with the EU s outermost regions . EN Official Journal of the European Union L 153 16 3.5.2021   74 The Programme should promote synergies, while avoiding duplication with related Union programmes and actions. The actions under the Programme should be complementary to those of the Customs and Fiscalis Programmes established by Regulation EU 2021 444 of the European Parliament and of the Council 38 and a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Fiscalis programme for cooperation in the field of taxation respectively, which also aim towards supporting and improving the functioning of the internal market. 75 The Programme should promote synergies, complementarities and additionality with respect to the SMEs and entrepreneurship support under the European Regional Development Fund established by a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund and on the Cohesion Fund. Moreover, the SME policy window of the InvestEU Fund will guarantee debt and equity support to enhance access and availability of finance for SMEs. The Programme should also seek synergies with the Space Programme established by Regulation EU 2021 696 of the European Parliament and of the Council 39 in respect of encouraging SMEs to benefit from breakthrough innovation and other solutions developed under that programme. 76 The Programme should promote synergies with Horizon Europe, which aims to promote research and innovation. This should concern in particular complementarity with the actions of the future European Innovation Council for innovative companies, as well as the support of services for SMEs, in particular via the EEN. 77 The Programme should promote synergies and complementarities with respect to the Digital Europe Programme which aims to promote the digitalisation of the Union economy and the public sector while increasing cybersecurity. 78 In addition, the Programme should also seek synergies with the Justice Programme established by Regulation EU 2021 693 of the European Parliament and of the Council 40 which aims to support the further development of a European area of justice for the effectiveness of national justice systems, since this is key to enabling the creation of a fair and cost effective Union economy. 79 The Programme should promote synergies with Erasmus programme, the European Solidarity Corps Programme established by Regulation EU XXXX XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council 41 and the European Social Fund Plus established by a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Social Fund Plus ESF in the area of labour and youth mobility, which is essential for the well functioning internal market. 80 Finally, actions such as veterinary and phytosanitary measures in case of animal and plant health crises could be complemented by market based interventions from the Union s Common Agriculture Policy programming. 81 The actions implemented under the Programme should represent clear Union added value and be used to address market failures, or sub optimal investment situations in a proportionate manner, without duplicating or crowding out private financing. 82 In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation EU No 182 2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 42 . The advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of work programmes implementing the actions contributing to the empowerment of consumers.

EN Official Journal of the European Union 3.5.2021 L 153 17  should be used respectively for the adoption of implementing acts related to the actions contributing to the competitiveness of SMEs and for the adoption of implementing acts related to the work programmes implementing the actions contributing to a high level of health for humans, animals, and plants and for establishing lower co financing rates where that is necessary for actions concerning veterinary and phytosanitary emergency measures and the annual and multiannual national veterinary and phytosanitary programmes as well as for the adoption of implementing acts related to the work programmes implementing the actions contributing to food and feed safety. 83 Where synergies between specific objectives of the Programme can be achieved, the necessary provisions could be implemented in a joint work programme. 84 The forms of Union funding and the methods of implementation of the Programme should be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the Union added value, the costs of controls, the administrative burden and the expected risk of non compliance. This should include considering the use of lump sums, flat rates and unit costs, as well as financing not linked to costs as referred to in Article 125 1 of the Financial Regulation. 85 To ensure regular monitoring and reporting on the progress achieved and on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Programme, a proper framework for monitoring the actions and results of the Programme should be put in place from the very beginning. Such monitoring and reporting should be based on indicators that measure the effects of the actions under the Programme against pre defined baselines. 86 Pursuant to paragraph 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law Making 43 , this Programme should be evaluated on the basis of information collected in accordance with specific monitoring requirements, while avoiding an administrative burden, in particular on Member States, and overregulation. Those requirements, where appropriate, should include measurable indicators as a basis for evaluating the effects of the Programme on the ground. The Commission should draw up an interim evaluation report on the achievement of the objectives of the actions supported under the Programme, on the results and impacts, on the efficiency of the use of resources and on its Union added value, as well as a final evaluation report on the longer impact, the results and the sustainability of the actions, and the synergies with other Programmes. 87 To monitor the support to SMEs, the Programme should use measurable performance indicators. Subject to the availability of information and where relevant, those indicators should measure results and impact achieved by the Programme in respect of its specific objectives and specific target groups for example women, youth and seniors . In particular, when monitoring, it is important to measure the support given to the green and digital transition, internationa lisation and innovation. In addition, monitoring should take into account contextual indicators, which do not measure the performance of the Programme, but which afford an overview of the environment in which SMEs operate. 88 A non exhaustive list of animal diseases and zoonoses which qualify for funding under emergency measures and for funding under the eradication, control and surveillance programmes should be established on the basis of animal diseases referred to in Regulation EC No 999 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council 44 , Regulation EC No 2160 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council 45 , Directive 2003 99 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 46 and Regulation EU 2016 429 of the European Parliament and of the Council 47 . 43 OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1. 44 Regulation EC No 999 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies OJ L 147, 31.5.2001, p. 1 . 45 Regulation EC No 2160 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the control of Salmonella and other specified food borne zoonotic agents OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, p. 1 . 46 Directive 2003 99 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90 424 EEC and repealing Council Directive 92 117 EEC OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, p. 31 . 47 Regulation EU 2016 429 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2016 on transmissible animal diseases and amending and repealing certain acts in the area of animal health Animal Health Law OJ L 84, 31.3.2016, p. 1 .

In order to take account of future developments concerning the entities which may be awarded a grant under the Programme in relation to the representation of consumer interest at the Union level, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the list of those entities. In order to ensure effective assessment of progress of the Programme towards the achievement of its objectives, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending, where necessary, the list of indicators used to measure the achievement of the specific objectives as well as supplementing this Regulation by establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law Making. Stakeholders and consumer associations should also be consulted. To ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. 90 Pursuant to Council Decision 2013 755 EU 48 , individuals and entities established in overseas countries or territories are eligible for funding subject to the rules and objectives of the Programme and possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or territory is linked. 91 In accordance with the Financial Regulation, Regulation EU, Euratom No 883 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 49 and Council Regulations EC, Euratom No 2988 95 50 , Euratom, EC No 2185 96 51 and EU 2017 1939 52 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected by means of proportionate measures, including measures relating to the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities, including fraud, to the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used, and, where appropriate, to the imposition of administrative penalties. In particular, in accordance with Regulations Euratom, EC No 2185 96 and EU, Euratom No 883 2013, OLAF has the power to carry out administrative investigations, including on the spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. The European Public Prosecutor s Office EPPO is empowered, in accordance with Regulation EU 2017 1939 to investigate and prosecute criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive EU 2017 1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 53 . In accordance with the Financial Regulation, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the financial interests of the Union, grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, in respect of those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation EU 2017 1939, the EPPO, and ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights. 92 Horizontal financial rules adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Article 322 TFEU apply to this Regulation.

Regulation EU 2018 1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council 55 governs the processing of personal data carried out by the Commission within the framework of this Regulation and under the supervision of the European Data Protection Supervisor. Any exchange or transmission of information by competent authorities is to comply with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Regulation EU 2016 679, any exchange or transmission of information by the Commission is to comply with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Regulation EU 2018 1725. 94 Regulation EC No 223 2009 establishes the rules of producing statistics in accordance with the principle of statistical confidentiality and stipulates that the National Statistical Institutes, other national authorities and the Commission Eurostat are to take all necessary measures to ensure the alignment of principles and guidelines with regard to the physical and logical protection of confidential data. 95 Since the objective of this Regulation, namely establishing a programme for improving the functioning of the internal market, the competitiveness and sustainability of enterprises, especially SMEs, and consumer protection, for the area of plants, animals, food and feed, and for the programming and financing framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics for the period 2021 2027, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the cross border nature of the issues involved, but can rather, by reason of the greater potential of Union action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. 96 The Programme should also ensure greater visibility and coherence of the Union s internal market, competitiveness and sustainability of enterprises, especially SMEs, and European statistics actions towards Union citizens, businesses and administrations. 97 Since amending provisions of legal acts exhaust their effects at the moment of their entry into force and the amendments they introduce in other legal acts thus become part of those legal acts at that same moment, the repeal of Regulation EU No 652 2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 56 has no effect on the amendments already introduced by its amending provisions in other legal acts, and in particular in Regulation EC No 178 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council 57 and Council Directive 2008 90 EC 58 with regard to the setting up of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed, which remains in force notwithstanding the repeal of Regulation EU No 652 2014. 54 Regulation EU 2016 679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95 46 EC General Data Protection Regulation OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1 . 55 Regulation EU 2018 1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation EC No 45 2001 and Decision No 1247 2002 EC OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39 . 56 Regulation EU No 652 2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 laying down provisions for the management of expenditure relating to the food chain, animal health and animal welfare, and relating to plant health and plant reproductive material, amending Council Directives 98 56 EC, 2000 29 EC and 2008 90 EC, Regulations EC No 178 2002, EC No 882 2004 and EC No 396 2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2009 128 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation EC No 1107 2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decisions 66 399 EEC, 76 894 EEC and 2009 470 EC OJ L 189, 27.6.2014, p. 1 . 57 Regulation EC No 178 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1 . 58 Council Directive 2008 90 EC of 29 September 2008 on the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production Recast version OJ L 267, 8.10.2008, p. 8 .

Together with Regulation EC No 223 2009, and especially with reference to the professional independence of statistical institutes and the other statistical principles laid down in Article 2 of that Regulation, the Programme is intended to provide the overall framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics for 2021 2027. European statistics are to be developed, produced and disseminated under that framework and in accordance with the principles of the European statistics Code of Practice. That framework should respect the quality criteria referred to in Article 12 1 of Regulation EC No 223 2009 through close and coordinated cooperation within the European Statistical System ESS . European statistics developed, produced and disseminated under this framework, will contribute to the implementation of the Union s policies as set out in the TFEU and further reflected in the Commission s strategic priorities. Through the Programme, the ESS will aim to maintain and improve its level of excellence in the statistical field. Likewise, the annual work programmes will aim to achieve the best possible output, taking into account the available resources at the regional, national and the Union level. Continuous research and innovation are considered as key drivers in modernising European statistics and in improving the quality of European statistics.
