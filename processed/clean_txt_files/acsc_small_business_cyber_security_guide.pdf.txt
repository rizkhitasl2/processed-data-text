Their goal is to scam you or your staff into sending money or gift cards clicking on malicious links or attachments giving away sensitive information, such as passwords. Cybercriminals may try and scam your business through email, text messages, phone calls and social media . They will often pretend to be a person or organisation you trust.   Phishing attacks Of particular concern to small businesses are phishing attacks . These scams often contain a link to a fake website where you are encouraged to log in to an account or enter confidential details. Phishing attacks typically compromise your account passwords . Cybercriminals often use this method to takeover the social media accounts of small businesses and hold them to ransom . Ways to mitigate If a message is from a known entity and seems suspicious, use caution. Contact the person or business separately to check if message is legitimate. Use contact details you find through a legitimate source, for instance by visiting the business s official website, and not those contained in the suspicious message . Learn more about identifying scams and phishing attacks with the following resources Recognise and report scams Learn how to spot phishing scams Detecting Socially Engineered Messages . Case study An employee at a courier company received an email from one of their executive staff, asking that they purchase 6 x 500 MasterCard prepaid credit cards . The executive told her to keep it confidential as the cards would be gift vouchers for staff members. Once purchased, the employee was asked to photograph both sides of the cards and send them through to the Executive as proof of purchase . As instructed, the employee went to a post office and used her personal credit card to purchase the gift cards . She replied to the executive s email and sent through photos of the gift cards as proof . After returning from the post office, the employee gave the physical cards to the executive who had no knowledge of them . On review, all emails about the gift cards came from a random email address and were not from the executive s legitimate email account. It had been a scam.  ACSC Small businesses cyber security guide 5 Case study A small construction business received an email from their supplier saying they had changed banks . The supplier provided new account details for invoice payments . Because the email seemed legitimate, the construction business did not call the supplier to confirm the change in bank account details. The business paid an invoice from the supplier for over 70,000. The following day, another employee mistakenly paid the same invoice again for an additional amount over 70,000. In total, over 150,000 was paid to the new bank account . When the business rang their supplier to ask if they could refund the duplicate payment, the supplier advised those banking details were incorrect . An investigation was launched immediately, and the supplier discovered that one of their email accounts had been hacked and was sending out fraudulent bank account details . No funds were recovered. Email attacks In addition to scams like phishing, a common email attack against small businesses is business email compromise BEC . Criminals can impersonate business representatives by using compromised email accounts, or through other means like using a domain name that looks similar to a real business . Aside from stealing information, the goal of these attacks is usually to scam victims into sending funds to a bank account operated by the scammer . Ways to mitigate The best defence against email attacks is training and awareness for your employees . Ensure your staff know to always be cautious of emails with the following requests for payments, especially if urgent or overdue change of bank details an email address that doesn t look quite right, such as the domain name not exactly matching the supplier s company name . While these attacks can be devastating, the mitigation measures are easy and cost almost nothing . When staff receive emails like this, the most effective mitigation is to call the sender to confirm they are legitimate. Do not use the contact details you have been sent as these could be fraudulent . Introduce a formal process for staff to follow when payment requests are received or bank details are changed . Learn to protect your business from BEC scams and email compromise with the following resources Business email compromise Protect your business from email fraud and compromise What to do if your business has been targeted by email fraud or compromise .  ACSC Small businesses cyber security guide 6 Malicious software Malware is a blanket term for malicious software designed to cause harm, such as ransomware, viruses, spyware and trojans. Malware can steal or lock the files on your device steal your bank or credit card numbers steal your usernames and passwords take control of or spy on your computer . Malware can stop your device from working properly, delete or corrupt your files, or allow others to access your personal or business information . If your device is infected with malware, you could be vulnerable to other attacks . The malware could also spread to other devices on your network . Your device can be infected by malware in a number of ways, including visiting websites that have been infected by malware downloading infected files or software from the internet opening infected email attachments . Ransomware Ransomware is a common and dangerous type of malware. It works by locking up or encrypting your files so you can no longer access them. A ransom, usually in the form of cryptocurrency, is demanded to restore access to the files. Cybercriminals might also threaten to publish or sell data online, unless a ransom is paid. Ways to mitigate While anti virus or security software can help protect you from malware, no software is 100 effective. Staff must be vigilant with emails, websites and file downloads, and regularly update their devices to stay secure . See the following resources for more information on protecting your business from ransomware Ransomware Protect yourself against ransomware attacks What to do if you re held to ransom . Case study Employees of an auto parts store came into work one morning and were not able to boot their server computer . When their IT provider got access to the server, they found a window open that said all the computer data had been encrypted . The note demanded they pay a ransom in bitcoin to unlock the files. There was a backup drive plugged into the computer, which had also been encrypted. They tried to connect more backup drives, but the files were automatically encrypted within seconds . They had failed to remove the ransomware before attempting to recover their data and lost every backup file they had. The only option left was to factory reset the server and start fresh with a new system . Their business lost many years of data and had to start over .  ACSC Small businesses cyber security guide 7 Secure your accounts  Turn on multi factor authentication  Multi factor authentication MFA makes it harder for cybercriminals to access your accounts. MFA adds another layer of security to your account . It is one of the most effective ways to protect your accounts from someone getting access, so you should use it wherever possible . Anyone who logs into your account will need to provide something else in addition to your username and password . This could be a unique code from a text message or an authenticator app. For more information, read our advice on MFA, available at cyber.gov.au mfa.  Turn on MFA wherever possible, starting with your most important accounts.   Implement access controls Restricting user access can limit the damage caused by a cyber security incident. Access control is a way to limit access to certain files and systems. Typically, staff do not require full access to all data, accounts, and systems in a business . They should only be allowed to access what they need to perform their duties . Restricting access will help limit the damage caused by a cyber security incident. For example, if a staff member s computer is infected with ransomware, with proper access controls it might only affect a small number of files rather than the entire business. Ensure each user can access only what they need for their role.  Use strong passwords or passphrases Protect your accounts from cybercriminals with a secure password or passphrase.  Many small businesses face cyber attacks as a result of poor password behaviours. For example, reusing the same password on multiple accounts . You can use both password managers and passphrases to create strong passwords.   A password manager acts like a virtual safe for your passwords. You can use it to create and store strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts . If you have a lot of accounts, this removes the burden of remembering unique passwords . You don t have to remember the passwords or the accounts they belong to, as it is all recorded in your password manager. For accounts that you sign into regularly, or that you otherwise don t want to store in a password manager, consider using a passphrase as your password . Passphrases are a combination of random words, for example crystal onion clay pretzel . They are useful when you want a secure password that is easy to remember . Use a random mix of four or more words and keep it unique do not reuse a passphrase across multiple accounts. For more information, read our read our advice on passphrases and password managers, available at cyber.gov.au passphrases . Use a password manager to create and store unique passwords for each of your important accounts. Manage shared accounts  Sharing accounts can compromise security and makes it difficult to track malicious activity.   In a small business, there may be legitimate reasons why staff need to share accounts, but it should be avoided as much as possible . When multiple staff use the same account it can be hard to track activity back to a specific employee and even harder to track cybercriminals breaking in . Unless you change the password, employees could also continue accessing accounts even after they have left the business.  Limit the use of shared accounts and secure any that are used in your business.  ACSC Small businesses cyber security guide 8 Protect your devices and information   Update your software   Keeping your software up to date is one of the best ways to protect your business from a cyber attack.  Updates can fix security flaws in your operating system and other software, so that it is harder for a cybercriminal to break in. New flaws are discovered all the time, so don t ignore prompts to update. Regularly updating your software will reduce the chance of a cybercriminal using a known weakness to run malware or hack your device. If you need help, the ACSC has published guidance on updates . If your device or software is too old, then updates may not be available . If the manufacturer has stopped supporting the product with updates, you should consider upgrading to a newer product to stay secure . Examples of systems that no longer receive major updates are the iPhone 7 and Microsoft Windows 7.  For more information read our guidance on updates, available at cyber.gov.au updates.  Turn on automatic updates for your devices and software.  Use security software Security software such as antivirus and ransomware protection can help protect your devices.
