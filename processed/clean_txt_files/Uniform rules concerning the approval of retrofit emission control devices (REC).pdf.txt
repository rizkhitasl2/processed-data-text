PERFORMANCE OF A SERVICE ACCUMULATION RUN The service accumulation run shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 9 of this Regulation. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF ENGINE BASELINE EMISSIONS AND SPECIFIC FUEL CONSUMPTION WITHOUT REC FITTED 2.1. The engine baseline emissions are established by performance of an emissions test on the engine system without the REC in accordance with the requirements of Regulation No 49 or Regulation No 96, as appropriate to the application and type approval level of the base engine. 2.2. To enable the determination of reduction efficiency the emissions are additionally established by performance of an emissions test in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 8.3 of this Regulation. 2.3. The specific fuel consumption g kWh shall be established by performance of the emissions test in paragraph 2.2 of this annex. 3. DETERMINATION OF EMISSIONS, FUEL CONSUMPTION AND REDUCTION EFFICIENCY WITH THE REC FITTED AFTER SERVICE ACCUMULATION RUN 3.1. The emissions are determined by performance of an emissions test in accordance with the requirements of Regulation No 49 or Regulation No 96, as appropriate to the intended application and intended emission level of the candidate REC with the REC fitted in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation. 3.2. For determination of reduction efficiency the emissions are additionally established by performance of an emissions test with the REC fitted in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 8.3 of this Regulation. 3.3. The specific fuel consumption g kWh shall be established by performance of the emissions test in paragraph 3.2 of this annex. 4. DETERMINATION OF PARTICULATE REDUCTION REC REGENERATION STRATEGY AND REGENERATION CHARACTER ISTICS 4.1. The particulate reduction REC regeneration strategy periodically or continuously and the regeneration charac teristics are established by use of the following procedure. 4.2. In order to assess the regeneration performance of a particulate reduction REC at least 25 test cycles shall be carried out. The test cycle used shall be a cycle appropriate to the emissions stage or standard that the REC system is intended to permit the vehicle or machine to meet. The gaseous emissions and the particulate mass, and the particle number when appropriate, shall be measured during at least each fifth test cycle. A separate test of the particulate reduction system is carried out for each family or application range defined in the type approval procedure for the engine with which the REC system is intended to be used. That is, one system test takes place for each application area. 4.3. A particulate reduction REC is considered to have been proved to have a continuously operating regeneration process if a suitable assessment variable can be regarded as constant over at least 25 applicable test cycles. The average particulate emission and the average exhaust gas backpressure are regarded as suitable assessment variables for this purpose. If an applicant wishes to use one or more different assessment variables, he shall present a robust technical case to the Type Approval Authority in support of his request to do so. Where a continuously regenerating system as defined above also contains provision for active regeneration, then the assessment criteria defined in paragraph 4.6 of this annex shall be applied. 27.4.2018 L 109 129 Official Journal of the European Union EN  The PM mass emission and the exhaust gas backpressure are considered constant within the meaning of this Regulation where there is a coefficient of variance of less than 25 per cent over 25 test cycles. The exhaust gas backpressure is measured continuously for the purposes of this assessment and the particulate emissions are measured during at least every fifth test cycle. The coefficient of variance CoV is calculated as follows Coefficient of variance ¼ Standard deviation XðnÞ Average value XðnÞ With Standard deviation ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi n P x2 ðP xÞ 2 nðn 1Þ s and Average value x1 x2 xn n Where n number of measured values x respective single measured value 4.4. Test of the regeneration characteristic of a particulate reduction REC This testing is carried out by loading the system with particulate matter until a constant exhaust gas backpressure is reached or over a time period of a maximum of 100 hours if no constant value for the backpressure has been achieved before that time. The exhaust gas backpressure is considered constant if, when measured after a period of at least 50 hours, the exhaust gas backpressure does not vary by more than plus or minus 4 mbar within a period of 30 min. The test points of the cycle used for loading the system are to be selected so that a maximum exhaust gas temperature of 180 C at the inlet of the particulate reduction system is not exceeded. The loading of the system with particulate matter is preferably carried out by running the test engine at a constant speed of between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of its rated speed. After the REC has been loaded with particulate matter until the backpressure is constant, or after a maximum of 100 hours of running to load the system as defined above, regeneration is activated. This can, for example, be activated by running the engine at a higher load mode step so as to increase the exhaust temperature. After completion of the regeneration, exhaust gas measurements are to be taken during at least three iterations of the appropriate test cycle That is, three ESC cycles, ETC cycles, WHSC cycles, WHTC cycles, NRSC cycles, or NRTC cycles. The measured exhaust gas pollutant values shall not deviate from the measured exhaust gas pollutant values before the REC loading procedure by more than 15 per cent for the gaseous emissions or more than 20 per cent for the particulate mass or particle number. The manufacturer shall confirm in writing that the maximum temperatures occurring during the regeneration process will not damage or significantly shorten the effective life of the REC. As an alternative to using the loading procedure described above, the manufacturer may provide a particulate reduction REC already loaded to the limit for the regeneration test. 4.5. Assessment criteria for continuously regenerating particulate reduction REC The REC system test of the particulate reduction REC is considered satisfactory if the particulate emissions measured as defined in paragraph 8 of this Regulation are met. 4.5.1. Regulated pollutants The emissions of the regulated pollutants are determined by measurements taken immediately after the tests to establish the regeneration characteristics. The emissions of the regulated pollutants CO, HC, PM and NOx in the initial condition and in the retrofitted condition shall be within the limit values for the emissions stage or standard for which the engine was originally type approved. The NO2 to NOx ratio for the initial condition and the retrofitted condition is to be recorded and shown in the test report. 27.4.2018 L 109 130 Official Journal of the European Union EN  The determination of the NO2 and NOx mass emissions is to be determined by simultaneous measurement in accordance with paragraph 13.2 of this Regulation. 4.6. Assessment criteria for periodically regenerating particulate reduction REC This provision only applies to REC which utilise active regeneration. The emissions shall be measured during at least three appropriate hot start test cycles That is, three hot start ESC cycles, ETC cycles, WHSC cycles, WHTC cycles, NRSC cycles, or NRTC cycles. One of the cycles from which measurements are taken should include a regeneration event on a stabilized REC system. The other two cycles from which measurements are taken should be cycles in which regeneration does not occur. If regeneration takes longer than one test cycle, consecutive test cycles shall be run until regeneration is complete. The REC manufacturer shall declare the conditions under which the regeneration process normally occurs the particulate loading, temperature, exhaust back pressure, or other relevant parameters . The manufacturer shall also provide the frequency of the regeneration event in terms of the fraction of tests during which the regeneration occurs. The exact procedure used to determine this fraction shall be agreed with the manufacturer by the Type Approval Authority on the basis of good engineering judgement. This frequency fraction is the factor F in the procedure for calculation of nominal particulate emissions set out below. For a regeneration test, the manufacturer shall provide a particulate reduction REC system that has been loaded with particulate matter. As an option, the manufacturer may run consecutive test cycles as set out in paragraph 4.4 of this annex until the particulate reduction REC is loaded. Emissions measurement is not required on cycles run for the purposes of loading the REC with particulate matter. Average emissions between regeneration phases shall be determined from the arithmetic mean of several tests approximately equidistant in terms of the number of unmeasured test cycles between them. As a minimum, at least one test cycle as close as possible prior to a regeneration test and one test cycle immediately after a regeneration test shall be included in the calculation of the arithmetic mean. During the regeneration test, all the data needed to detect regeneration shall be recorded CO or NOx emissions, temperature before and after the REC, exhaust back pressure, and any other relevant parameters . It is permissible for the applicable emission limits to be exceeded during the regeneration process. The test procedure is shown schematically in the figure below. Scheme of periodic regeneration 27.4.2018 L 109 131 Official Journal of the European Union EN  The system test of a periodically regenerating particulate reduction REC is considered passed if the nominal particulate emissions calculated using the procedure set out below are within the limit set for the reduction level for which the applicant wishes the REC to be approved. 4.6.1. Regulated pollutants The emissions of regulated pollutants CO, HC, PM and NOx shall not exceed the limit values for the standard to which the engine was originally type approved, both in the initial condition and in the retrofitted condition. The NO2 NOx ratio for both the initial condition and the retrofitted condition are to be recorded and shown in the test report. The determination of the NO2 and NOx mass emissions is to be determined by simultaneous measurement in accordance with paragraph 4.7.2 of this annex and paragraph 13 of this Regulation. 4.6.1.1. Weighted particulate emissions The particulate emissions PM mass g kWh for periodically regenerating systems are determined as follows. PM mass PM massr F 1 F PM masswor Where F frequency of the regeneration event in terms of fraction of tests during which the regeneration occurs PM masswor average specific emission from a test in which the regeneration does not occur g kWh PM massr average specific emission from a test in which the regeneration occurs g kWh The manufacturer may choose, on the basis of good engineering analysis, to calculate either a multiplicative or an additive regeneration adjustment factor kr, expressing the average emission rate, as follows k r PM mass PM masswor multiplicative adjustment factor or k Ur PM mass PM masswor upward adjustment factor or k Dr PM mass PM mass r downward adjustment factor If more than two measurements between the regeneration phases are used to determine the emissions, these further measurements shall be taken at equal intervals and an arithmetical average taken. 4.6.1.2. Weighted gaseous emissions The emission of gaseous components Mgas g kWh for periodically regenerating systems is determined as follows. Mgas Mgasr F 1 F Mgaswor Where F frequency of the regeneration event in terms of the fraction of tests during which the regeneration occurs Mgaswor average specific emission from a test in which the regeneration does not occur g kWh Mgasr average specific emission from a test in which the regeneration occurs g kWh The manufacturer may choose, on the basis of good engineering analysis, to calculate either a multiplicative or an additive the regeneration adjustment factor kr, expressing the average emission rate, as follows k r Mgas Mgaswor multiplicative adjustment factor or k Ur Mgas Mgaswor upward adjustment factor or k Dr Mgas Mgas r downward adjustment factor 27.4.2018 L 109 132 Official Journal of the European Union EN  4.7. Determination of NO2 emissions The testing shall be performed on the test engine selected by the criteria described in paragraph 12 of this Regulation. 4.7.1. Selection of the particulate reduction REC for NO2 determination. The REC used for testing may be different from the REC used in paragraph 4.5 of this annex. The particulate reduction REC to be tested shall be a A particulate reduction REC with the largest active volume and, if a diesel oxidation catalyst DOC is used upstream, the catalytic converter with the largest active surface area and b The particulate reduction REC containing the maximum charge of platinum with the maximum total charge of catalytically active material within the defined REC family. The chosen particulate reduction REC shall be fitted in such a way that the shortest distance between the engine and the particulate reduction REC, as specified in the application range for the particulate reduction REC, is achieved. The particulate reduction REC shall be unloaded and shall not have been run in for longer than 125 hours. 4.7.2. Determination of NO2 emissions Three successive WHTC or NRTC test cycles, as appropriate to the application, shall be conducted. The emissions shall be determined over all three cycles and averaged. If the range of these results is greater than 15 per cent of the mean, then an additional test cycle should be run. The calculation of the NOx and NO2 emissions shall be determined for CI engines used in vehicles of category M and N over the complete WHTC cycle. For CI engines used in non road mobile machinery or Category T vehicles having an installed net power higher than 18 kW, but not more than 560 kW the calculation of the NOx and NO2 emissions shall be determined over the complete NRTC cycle. 5.
