Accordingly, the provisions of this Regulation should be supplemented in the light of devel opments in that policy. 3 The rules on competition relating to the agreements, decisions and practices referred to in Article 81 of the Treaty and to the abuse of dominant positions are to be applied to the production of, and trade in, agricultural products, in so far as their application does not impede the functioning of national organisations of agricultural markets or jeopardise attainment of the objectives of the common agricultural policy. 4 Special attention is warranted in the case of farmers organisations the particular objective of which is the joint production or marketing of agricultural products or the use of joint facilities, unless such joint action excludes competition or jeopardises attainment of the objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty. 5 In order both to avoid compromising the development of a common agricultural policy and to ensure certainty in the law and non discriminatory treatment of the under takings concerned, the Commission should have sole power, subject to review by the Court of Justice, to determine whether the conditions provided for in the two preceding recitals are fulfilled as regards the agreements, decisions and practices referred to in Article 81 of the Treaty. 6 In order to implement, as part of the development of the common agricultural policy, the rules on aid for production of, or trade in, agricultural products, the Commission should be in a position to draw up a list of existing, new or proposed types of aid, to make appropriate observations to the Member States and to propose suitable measures to them, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION Article 1 Articles 81 to 86 of the Treaty and provisions made for their implementation shall, subject to Article 2 of this Regulation, apply to all agreements, decisions and practices referred to in Articles 81 1 and 82 of the Treaty which relate to production of, or trade in, the products listed in Annex I to the Treaty. Article 2 1. Article 81 1 of the Treaty shall not apply to such of the agreements, decisions and practices referred to in Article 1 of this Regulation as form an integral part of a national market organisation or are necessary for attainment of the objectives set out in Article 33 of the Treaty In particular, it shall not apply to agreements, decisions and practices of farmers, farmers associations, or associations of such associations belonging to a single Member State which concern the production or sale of agricultural products or the use of joint facilities for the storage, treatment or processing of agricultural products, and under which there is no obligation to charge identical prices, unless the Commission finds that competition is thereby excluded or that the objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty are jeopardised.
