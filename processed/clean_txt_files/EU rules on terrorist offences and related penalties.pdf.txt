 Acts adopted pursuant to Title VI of the Treaty on European Union COUNCIL FRAMEWORK DECISION of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism 2002 475 JHA THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Union, and in particular Article 29, Article 31 e and Article 34 2 b thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission 1 , Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament 2 , Whereas 1 The European Union is founded on the universal values of human dignity, liberty, equality and solidarity, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is based on the principle of democracy and the principle of the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States. 2 Terrorism constitutes one of the most serious violations of those principles. The La Gomera Declaration adopted at the informal Council meeting on 14 October 1995 af firmed that terrorism constitutes a threat to democracy, to the free exercise of human rights and to economic and social development. 3 All or some Member States are party to a number of conventions relating to terrorism. The Council of Europe Convention of 27 January 1977 on the Suppression of Terrorism does not regard terrorist offences as political offences or as offences connected with political offences or as offences inspired by political motives. The United Nations has adopted the Convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings of 15 December 1997 and the Convention for the suppression of financing terrorism of 9 December 1999. A draft global Convention against ter rorism is currently being negotiated within the United Nations. 4 At European Union level, on 3 December 1998 the Council adopted the Action Plan of the Council and the Commission on how best to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on an area of freedom, se curity and justice 3 . Account should also be taken of the Council Conclusions of 20 September 2001 and of the Extraordinary European Council plan of action to com bat terrorism of 21 September 2001. Terrorism was re ferred to in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999, and of the Santa Mar√≠a da Feira European Council of 19 and 20 June 2000. It was also mentioned in the Commission commu nication to the Council and the European Parliament on the biannual update of the scoreboard to review progress on the creation of an area of freedom, security and jus tice in the European Union second half of 2000 . Furthermore, on 5 September 2001 the European Parlia ment adopted a recommendation on the role of the Eur opean Union in combating terrorism. It should, more over, be recalled that on 30 July 1996 twenty five measures to fight against terrorism were advocated by the leading industrialised countries G7 and Russia meeting in Paris. 5 The European Union has adopted numerous specific measures having an impact on terrorism and organised crime, such as the Council Decision of 3 December 1998 instructing Europol to deal with crimes committed or likely to be committed in the course of terrorist activities against life, limb, personal freedom or prop erty 4 Council Joint Action 96 610 JHA of 15 October 1996 concerning the creation and maintenance of a Di rectory of specialised counter terrorist competences, skills and expertise to facilitate counter terrorism coop eration between the Member States of the European Un ion 5 Council Joint Action 98 428 JHA of 29 June 1998 on the creation of a European Judicial Network 6 , with responsibilities in terrorist offences, in particular Article 2 Council Joint Action 98 733 JHA of 21 De cember 1998 on making it a criminal offence to partici pate in a criminal organisation in the Member States of the European Union 7 and the Council Recommenda tion of 9 December 1999 on cooperation in combating the financing of terrorist groups 8 . 22.6.2002 L 164 3 Official Journal of the European Communities EN 1 OJ C 332 E, 27.11.2001, p. 300. 2 Opinion delivered on 6 February 2002 not yet published in the Of ficial Journal . 3 OJ C 19, 23.1.1999, p. 1. 4 OJ C 26, 30.1.1999, p. 22. 5 OJ L 273, 25.10.1996, p. 1. 6 OJ L 191, 7.7.1998, p. 4. 7 OJ L 351, 29.12.1998, p. 1. 8 OJ C 373, 23.12.1999, p. 1.   6 The definition of terrorist offences should be approxi mated in all Member States, including those offences re lating to terrorist groups. Furthermore, penalties and sanctions should be provided for natural and legal per sons having committed or being liable for such offences, which reflect the seriousness of such offences. 7 Jurisdictional rules should be established to ensure that the terrorist offence may be effectively prosecuted. 8 Victims of terrorist offences are vulnerable, and therefore specific measures are necessary with regard to them. 9 Given that the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States unilater ally, and can therefore, because of the need for recipro city, be better achieved at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the prin ciple of subsidiarity. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, this Framework Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those ob jectives. 10 This Framework Decision respects fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protec tion of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they emerge from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States as principles of Community law. The Union observes the principles recognised by Article 6 2 of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Un ion, notably Chapter VI thereof. Nothing in this Frame work Decision may be interpreted as being intended to reduce or restrict fundamental rights or freedoms such as the right to strike, freedom of assembly, of association or of expression, including the right of everyone to form and to join trade unions with others for the protection of his or her interests and the related right to demon strate. 11 Actions by armed forces during periods of armed con flict, which are governed by international humanitarian law within the meaning of these terms under that law, and, inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of in ternational law, actions by the armed forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties are not governed by this Framework Decision, HAS ADOPTED THIS FRAMEWORK DECISION Article 1 Terrorist offences and fundamental rights and principles 1.
