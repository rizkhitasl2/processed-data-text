Calculation assumptions 7 The calculations in this regulation rely on the assumptions in the table. Item Assumption 1 The cost of an adverse impact is to be worked out on the basis of the cost that would accrue if the event which causes the adverse impact occurs 2 An impact year is a financial year in which an impact occurs, or would occur 3 The base year is the financial year in which the calculation is made 4 The long term bond rate is the average, expressed as a decimal fraction, of the assessed secondary market yields in respect of 10 year non rebate Treasury bonds for the latest available 12 months at the time the calculation is made, as published by the Reserve Bank of Australia 5 The total resource value for the purposes of sections 25 and 26 of the Act is the expected future revenue stream from greenhouse gas injection, taking into account matters including a the amount of greenhouse gas projected to be stored by the operation and b the projected injection profile and projected carbon prices worked out as the present value of future greenhouse gas substances expected to be produced, and discounted if necessary using the formula in subregulation 6 6 The total resource value for the purposes of sections 27, 27A, 28, 28A and 29 of the Act is the expected future revenue stream from a petroleum resource, taking into account a the amount of petroleum projected to be recoverable by the operation and b the projected production profile and projected petroleum prices worked out as the present value of future petroleum expected to be produced, discounted if necessary using the formula in subregulation 6 7 Prescribed costs for the purposes of subsections 25 5 , 26 5 , 27 5 , 27A 5 , 28 5 , 28A 5 and 29 5 of the Act include any costs incurred by a party in analysing possible impacts or developing or providing information to inform the application of a test 1.6 Significant risk of a significant adverse impact threshold amounts 1 This regulation a is made for subsections 25 6 , 26 6 , 27 6 , 27A 6 , 28 6 , 28A 6 and 29 6 of the Act and b sets out the amount that is taken to be the probability weighted impact cost of an operation for the purposes of those subsections and c sets out the amount that is taken to be the threshold amount for the purposes of those subsections. Probability weighted impact cost 2 The probability weighted impact cost is identified in 2 forms Authorised Version F2020C00971 registered 26 10 2020   Part 1 Introduction Regulation 1.6 6 Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Greenhouse Gas Injection and Storage Regulations 2011 Compilation No. 1 Compilation date 01 10 2020 Registered 26 10 2020 a the cost of the economic consequences of an adverse impact, worked out using the formula in subregulation 1.5 3 and b the cost of the economic consequences of an adverse impact relative to the potential economic value of operations that are being, or could be, carried on, worked out using the formula in subregulation 1.5 4 . Note To be certain of whether a risk is, or is not, to be treated as a significant risk of the occurrence of a significant adverse impact a the cost of the economic consequences of an adverse impact is used for the purposes of comparison with the first threshold amount and b the cost of the economic consequences of an adverse impact relative to the potential economic value of operations that are being, or could be, carried on is used for the purposes of comparison with the second threshold amount. If either cost exceeds its relevant threshold, the risk is to be treated as a significant risk of the occurrence of a significant adverse impact. First threshold amount 3 For the financial year starting on 1 July 2010 a the first threshold amount is 5 000 000 and b the first threshold amount is used for comparison with the cost of the economic consequences of an adverse impact, worked out using the formula in subregulation 1.5 3 . Second threshold amount 4 For the financial year starting on 1 July 2010 a the second threshold amount is 0.0015 and b the second threshold amount is used for comparison with the cost of the economic consequences of an adverse impact relative to the potential economic value of operations that are being, or could be, carried on, worked out using the formula in subregulation 1.5 4 . Increase in amounts 5 For a base year later than 2010, the first threshold mentioned in paragraph 3 a is increased using the formula base year 2010 amount 1 GDP deflator where GDP deflator, for the base year, is the Implicit Price Deflator for Expenditure on Gross Domestic Product first published by the Australian Statistician in respect of the base year. base year is the base year in the table of assumptions in subregulation 1.5 7 .
