REGULATION EU No 1290 2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 11 December 2013 laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in Horizon 2020 the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014 2020 and repealing Regulation EC No 1906 2006 Text with EEA relevance THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 173, 183, and the second paragraph of Article 188 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors 1 , Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 2 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 3 , Whereas 1 Horizon 2020 the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014 2020 Horizon 2020 is established by Regulation EU No 1291 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Coun cil 4 . That Regulation needs to be complemented by rules for participation in indirect actions undertaken under Horizon 2020, and for exploitation and dissemi nation of the results of those actions. 2 Horizon 2020 should be implemented with a view to contributing directly to creating industrial leadership, growth and employment as well as citizens welfare in Europe, and should reflect the strategic vision of the Commission Communication of 6 October 2010 entitled Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative Innovation , in which the Commission commits itself to radically simplify access for participants. 3 Horizon 2020 should support the achievement and func tioning of the European Research Area in which researchers, scientific knowledge and technology circulate freely, by strengthening cooperation both between the Union and the Member States, and among the Member States, in particular through the application of a coherent set of rules. 4 The rules for participation, exploitation and dissemi nation in Horizon 2020 laid down in this Regulation the Rules should adequately reflect the recommen dations of the European Parliament in its resolution of 11 November 2010 on simplifying the implementation of the Research Framework Programmes 5 , and of the Council with regard to the simplification of the adminis trative and financial requirements of the research framework programmes. The Rules should provide continuity to the simplification measures already imple mented under Decision No 1982 2006 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 . They should take up the recommendations made in the final report of the Expert Group entitled Interim Evaluation of the 7th Framework Programme of 12 November 2010 and they should enable further progress in reducing the administrative burden for participants and the complexity of the financial provisions in order to facilitate partici pation and reduce the number of financial errors. The Rules should also duly reflect the concerns raised and recommendations made by the research community resulting from the debate initiated by the Commission Communication of 29 April 2010 entitled Simplifying the implementation of the research framework programmes , and the subsequent Green Paper of 9 February 2011 entitled From Challenges to Oppor tunities Towards a Common Strategic Framework for EU Research and Innovation funding . 5 The interim evaluation of Horizon 2020 should include an evaluation of the new funding model, including its impact on funding levels, on participation in Horizon 2020 and on the attractiveness of Horizon 2020. 6 The Commission or the relevant funding body should ensure that guidance and information is made available to all potential participants at the time of publication of the call for proposals.

Common rules should apply in order to ensure a coherent framework which should facilitate participation in programmes receiving Union financial contributions from the budget of Horizon 2020, including participation in programmes managed by the EIT, joint undertakings or any other structures under Article 187 of the Treaty on the Func tioning of the European Union TFEU , and participation in programmes undertaken by Member States pursuant to Article 185 TFEU. However, flexibility to adopt specific rules should be ensured when justified by the specific needs of the respective actions. In order to take into account the specific operating needs as identified in the framework of the relevant basic act of the bodies set up under Article 187 TFEU, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure the simultaneous, timely and appro priate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. 9 Actions which fall within the scope of this Regulation should respect fundamental rights and observe the prin ciples acknowledged in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Such actions should be in conformity with any legal obligation including international law and with any relevant Commission decisions such as the Commission notice of 28 June 2013 5 , as well as with ethical principles, which include avoiding any breach of research integrity. 10 In line with the objectives of international cooperation as set out in Articles 180 and 186 TFEU, the participation of legal entities established in third countries and of international organisations should be promoted. The implementation of the Rules should be in conformity with the measures adopted in accordance with Articles 75 and 215 TFEU and should be in compliance with international law. Moreover, the implementation of the Rules should duly take into account the conditions for the participation of Union entities in third countries corresponding programmes. 11 The Rules should provide a coherent, comprehensive and transparent framework to ensure the most efficient implementation possible, taking into account the need for easy access by all participants through simplified procedures, in particular with regard to micro , small , and medium sized enterprises SMEs . The financial assistance from the Union could be provided in various forms. 12 In line with the principle of transparency and in addition to the publicity requirement set out in Regulation EU, Euratom No 966 2012 and in Regulation EU No 1268 2012, the Commission should publish open calls for proposals on the internet pages of Horizon 2020, through specific information channels, and should ensure their wide dissemination, including via national contact points and upon request in accessible formats, where practicable. 13 The selection and award criteria laid down in this Regu lation should be applied in a transparent way and based on objective and measurable parameters, taking into account the overall aim of Horizon 2020 to achieve a well functioning European Research Area. 14 In general, the period between the final date for the submission of complete proposals and the signing of grant agreements with applicants or notifying grant decisions to them should be shorter than the period provided for in Regulation EU, Euratom No 966 2012. In duly justified cases and for actions of the European Research Council a longer period should be allowed.

The system may also provide feedback to applicants on the progress and the timeline of their applications. 16 The handling of confidential data and classified information should be governed by all relevant Union law, including the Institutions internal rules, such as Commission Decision 2001 844 EC, ECSC, Euratom 1 which lays down the provisions on security of European Union classified information. 17 It is necessary to establish the minimum conditions for participation, both as a general rule and with regard to the specificities of the actions under Horizon 2020. In particular, rules should be laid down regarding the number of participants and their places of establishment. In the case of an action without the participation of an entity established in a Member State, the attainment of the objectives laid down in Articles 173 and 179 TFEU should be pursued. 18 Pursuant to Council Decision 2001 822 EC 2 , legal entities of overseas countries and territories are eligible to participate in Horizon 2020 subject to the specific conditions laid down in the latter. 19 The Commission should consider the timings of calls for proposals and requests for information taking into account, where possible, standard holiday periods. 20 In the case of unsuccessful proposals, the Commission should give feedback to the applicants concerned. 21 Clear and transparent mechanisms to develop calls for proposals on specific topics should enable a level playing field, increase the attractiveness of Horizon 2020 and increase participation. 22 The Commission should in all aspects of Horizon 2020 act in accordance with the principles of the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour as set out in the annex to Commission Decision 2000 633 EC, ECSC, Euratom 3 . 23 It is appropriate to establish the terms and conditions for providing Union funding to participants in actions under Horizon 2020. In order to reduce the complexity of the existing funding rules, a simplified cost reimbursement system should be adopted with enhanced use of lump sums, flat rates and unit costs. 24 The reimbursement rates in this Regulation are referred to as maximums in order to comply with the non profit requirement and the co financing principle, and to allow participants to request a lower rate. In principle, the reimbursement rates should however be 100 or 70 . 25 The OECD definitions regarding Technological Readiness Level TRL should be taken into account in the classifi cation of technological research, product development and demonstration activities. 26 Specific challenges in the area of research and innovation should be addressed through new forms of funding such as prizes, pre commercial procurement, public procurement of innovative solutions, the SME Instrument and the Fast Track to Innovation actions, which require specific rules. 27 In order to maintain a level playing field for all under takings active in the internal market, funding provided by Horizon 2020 should be designed in accordance with State aid rules so as to ensure the effectiveness of public spending and prevent market distortions such as crowding out of private funding, the creation of inef fective market structures or the preservation of inefficient firms. Care should be taken to ensure that funding of innovation actions neither distorts competition nor leads to market interference without sufficient cause. 28 The financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expen diture cycle, ensuring an appropriate balance between trust and control. 29 In accordance with Regulation EU, Euratom No 966 2012, the Rules should provide the basis for a wider acceptance of the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiaries. EN 20.12.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 347 83 1 2001 844 EC,ECSC,Euratom Commission Decision of 29 November 2001 amending its internal Rules of Procedure OJ L 317, 3.12.2001 . 2 Council Decision 2001 822 EC of 27 November 2001 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community Overseas Association Decision OJ L 314, 30.11.2001, p. 1 . 3 2000 633 EC, ECSC, Euratom Commission Decision of 17 October 2000 amending its Rules of Procedure OJ L 267, 20.10.2000, p. 63 .   30 The participant Guarantee Fund set up under Regulation EC No 1906 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 and managed by the Commission has proved to be an important safeguard mechanism which mitigates the risks associated with the amounts due and not reimbursed by defaulting participants. Therefore, a new participant Guarantee Fund the Fund should be established. In order to ensure more efficient management and better coverage of participants risk, the Fund should cover actions under the programme set up under Decision No 1982 2006 EC, under the programme set up by Council Decision 2006 970 Eura tom 2 , under the programme set up by Council Decision 2012 93 Euratom 3 as well as actions under Horizon 2020 and Regulation Euratom No 1314 2013 of the Council 4 . Programmes managed by entities other than Union funding bodies should not be covered by the Fund. 31 In order to enhance transparency, the names of experts that have assisted the Commission or relevant funding bodies in the application of this Regulation should be published. Where the publication of the name would endanger the security or integrity of the expert or would unduly prejudice his or her privacy, the Commission or funding bodies should be able to refrain from the publication of such names. 32 Personal data relating to the experts should be processed in accordance with Regulation EC No 45 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 . 33 Rules governing the exploitation and dissemination of results should be laid down to ensure that participants protect, exploit and disseminate those results as appro priate, and to provide for the possibility of additional exploitation conditions in the European strategic interest. Participants that have received Union funding, and that plan to exploit the results generated with such funding primarily in third countries not associated with Horizon 2020, should indicate how the Union funding will benefit Europe s overall competitiveness reciprocity principle , as set out in the grant agreement. 34 In the case of research with the potential for further development into a novel medical technology such as drugs, vaccines and medical diagnostics , measures should be taken to ensure the immediate exploitation and dissemination of the results, where appropriate. 35 Despite the success of existing Union debt and equity financial instruments for research, development, inno vation and growth, access to risk finance remains a key issue, in particular for innovative SMEs. In order to allow their most effective use, debt and equity financial instruments should be allowed to be combined with each other and with grants funded under the Union budget, including under Horizon 2020. Moreover, the Commission should, in particular, ensure continuity of the Risk Sharing Finance Facility RSFF set up under Decision No 1982 2006 EC and the early stage part of the High Growth and Innovative SME Facility GIF1 set up under Decision No 1639 2006 EC within their succeeding debt and equity financial instruments under Horizon 2020, respectively the Union loan guarantee service for Research and innovation and the Union Equity Instruments for research and innovation . In this context, revenues and repayments generated by any of those financial instruments should directly benefit the financial instruments set up under Horizon 2020. 36 The Commission should ensure sufficient complemen tarities between the SME instrument under Horizon 2020 and the financial instruments under Horizon 2020 and the COSME programme established under Regulation EU No 1287 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 , as well as with schemes and instruments set up jointly with Member States, such as the Eurostars Joint Programme 7 . 37 For reasons of legal certainty and clarity, Regulation EC No 1906 2006 should be repealed, EN L 347 84 Official Journal of the European Union 20.12.2013 1 Regulation No 1906 2006 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 laying down the rules for the partici pation of undertakings, research centres and universities in actions under the Seventh Framework Programme and for the dissemination of research results 2007 2013 OJ L 391, 30.12.2006, p. 1 . 2 Council Decision 2006 970 Euratom of 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community Euratom for nuclear research and training activities 2007 to 2011 OJ L 400, 30.12.2006, p. 60 . 3 2012 93 Euratom Council Decision of 19 December 2011 concerning the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for nuclear research and training activities 2012 to 2013 OJ L 47, 18.2.2012, p. 25 . 4 Regulation Euratom No 1314 2013 of the Council on the Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community 2014 2018 complementing Horizon 2020 the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation See page 948 of this Official Journal . 5 Regulation EC No 45 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community insti tutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data OJ L 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1 . 6 Regulation EU No 1287 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing a Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and small and medium sized enter prises COSME 2014 2020 and repealing Decision No 1639 2006 EC See page 33 of this Official Journal . 7 Decision No 743 2008 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the Community s participation in a research and development programme undertaken by several Member States aimed at supporting research and development performing small and medium sized enterprises OJ L 201, 30.7.2008, p. 58 .

Independent experts shall be chosen on the basis of their skills, experience and knowledge appropriate to carry out the tasks assigned to them. In cases where independent experts have to deal with classified information, the appropriate security clearance shall be required before appointment. Independent experts shall be identified and selected on the basis of calls for applications from individuals and calls addressed to relevant organisations such as research agencies, research insti tutions, universities, standardisation organisations, civil society organisations or enterprises with a view to establishing a database of candidates. The Commission or the relevant funding body may, if deemed appropriate and in duly justified cases, select in a transparent manner any individual expert with the appropriate skills not included in the database. When appointing independent experts, the Commission or the relevant funding body shall take appropriate measures to seek a balanced composition within the expert groups and evaluation panels in terms of various skills, experience, knowledge, geographical diversity and gender, and taking into account the situation in the field of the action. Where appropriate, private public sector balance shall also be sought. The Commission or the relevant funding body may call upon the advice of advisory bodies for the appointment of inde pendent experts. In the case of ERC frontier research actions, the Commission shall appoint experts on the basis of a proposal from the Scientific Council of the ERC. 3. The Commission or the relevant funding body shall ensure that an expert faced with a conflict of interest in relation to a matter on which the expert is required to provide an opinion does not evaluate, advise or assist on the specific matter in question. 4. All exchanges with independent experts, including the conclusion of contracts for their appointment and any amendment thereto, may be done through electronic exchange systems set up by the Commission or by the relevant funding body as stipulated in Article 287 4 of Regu lation EU No. 1268 2012. 5.

Results shall be owned by the participant generating them. 2. Where participants in an action have jointly generated results, and where their respective contribution to the joint results cannot be ascertained, or where it is not possible to separate such joint results for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining the relevant intellectual property rights protection, they shall have joint ownership of those results. The joint owners shall establish an agreement regarding the allocation and terms of exercise of that joint ownership in accordance with their obligations under the grant agreement. The joint owners may agree not to continue with joint ownership but decide on an alternative regime, inter alia by transferring their ownership shares to a single owner with access rights for the other participants, once the results have been generated. Unless otherwise agreed in the joint ownership agreement, each joint owner shall be entitled to grant non exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the jointly owned results, without any right to sub license, subject to the following conditions a prior notice shall be given to the other joint owners b fair and reasonable compensation shall be provided to the other joint owners. 3. If employees or any party working for a participant are entitled to claim rights to the results generated, the participant concerned shall ensure that it is possible for those rights to be exercised in a manner compatible with its obligations under the grant agreement. Article 42 Protection of results 1. Where results are capable of or may reasonably be expected to be capable of commercial or industrial exploitation, the participant owning those results shall examine the possi bility of protecting them. The participant shall, if possible, reasonable and justified given the circumstances, adequately protect them for an appropriate period of time and with an appropriate territorial coverage, having due regard to its legitimate interests, and the legitimate interests, particularly the commercial interests, of the other participants in the action. 2. Where a participant that has received Union funding intends not to protect results generated by it for reasons other than impossibility under Union or national law or the lack of potential for commercial or industrial exploitation, and unless the participant intends to transfer them to another legal entity established in a Member State or associated country in view of their protection, it shall inform the Commission or the relevant funding body before any dissemination relating to those results takes place. The Commission, on behalf of the Union, or the relevant funding body may, with the consent of the participant concerned, assume ownership of those results and take the necessary steps for their adequate protection. The participant may refuse consent only if it demonstrates that its legitimate interests would suffer significant harm. No dissemination relating to those results may take place until the Commission or the relevant funding body has taken a decision not to assume ownership of the results or has decided that it will assume ownership and has taken the necessary steps to ensure their protection. The Commission or the relevant funding body shall make such decision without undue delay. The grant agreement shall lay down time limits in this respect. 3. Where a participant that has received Union funding intends to abandon the protection of results or intends not to seek the extension of such protection for reasons other than the lack of potential for commercial or industrial exploitation within a period that shall not exceed five years following the payment of the balance, it shall inform the Commission or the relevant funding body, which may continue or extend protection by assuming ownership thereof. The participant may refuse consent only if it demonstrates that its legitimate interests would suffer significant harm. The grant agreement shall lay down time limits in this respect. Article 43 Exploitation and dissemination of results 1. Each participant that has received Union funding shall use its best efforts to exploit the results it owns, or to have them exploited by another legal entity, in particular through the transfer and licensing of results in accordance with Article 44. Any additional exploitation obligations shall be laid down in the grant agreement. In the case of research with the potential to address major societal challenges, additional exploitation obligations may include licensing on non exclusive terms. Any such additional obligations shall be indicated in the work programme or work plan. EN L 347 98 Official Journal of the European Union 20.12.2013  2. Subject to any restrictions due to the protection of intel lectual property, security rules or legitimate interests, each participant shall through appropriate means disseminate the results it owns as soon as possible. The grant agreement may lay down time limits in this respect. Any additional dissemination obligations shall be laid down in the grant agreement and indicated in the work programme or work plan. With regard to the dissemination of results through scientific publications, open access shall apply under the terms and conditions laid down in the grant agreement. Costs relating to open access to scientific publications that result from research funded under Horizon 2020, incurred within the duration of an action, shall be eligible for reimbursement under the conditions of the grant agreement. With due regard to Article 18 of Regu lation EU No 1291 2013, the grant agreement shall not stipulate conditions regarding open access to publications which would result in additional publishing costs after the completion of an action. With regard to the dissemination of research data, the grant agreement may, in the context of the open access to and the preservation of research data, lay down terms and conditions under which open access to such results shall be provided, in particular in ERC frontier research and FET Future and Emerging Technologies research or in other appropriate areas, and taking into consideration the legitimate interests of the participants and any constraints pertaining to data protection rules, security rules or intellectual property rights. In such cases, the work programme or work plan shall indicate if the dissemi nation of research data through open access is required. Prior notice of any dissemination activity shall be given to the other participants. Following notification, a participant may object if it demonstrates that its legitimate interests in relation to its results or background would suffer significant harm by the intended dissemination. In such cases, the dissemination may not take place unless appropriate steps are taken to safeguard those legitimate interests. The grant agreement shall lay down time limits in this respect. 3. For the purposes of monitoring and dissemination by the Commission or the relevant funding body, participants shall provide any information on their exploitation and dissemi nation related activities, and provide any documents necessary in accordance with the conditions laid down in the grant agreement. Subject to the legitimate interests of the participants which have provided the information, such information shall be made publicly available. The grant agreement shall, inter alia, lay down time limits with respect to such reporting obligations. 4. All patent applications, standards, publications or any other dissemination, including those in electronic form, relating to results shall, if possible, include a statement, which may include visual means, that the action received financial support from the Union. The terms of that statement shall be established in the grant agreement. Article 44 Transfer and licensing of results 1. Where a participant transfers ownership of results, it shall pass on its obligations under the grant agreement regarding those results to the transferee, including the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent transfer. Without prejudice to confidentiality obligations arising from laws or regulations in the case of mergers and acquisitions, where other participants still enjoy access rights or may still request the granting of access rights to the results to be trans ferred, a participant which intends to transfer the results shall give prior notice to the other participants, together with sufficient information concerning the intended new owner of the results, to permit the other participants to analyse the effect of the intended transfer on the possible exercise of their access rights. Following notification, a participant may object to the transfer of ownership if it demonstrates that the intended transfer would adversely affect the exercise of its access rights. In such a case, the transfer may not take place until agreement has been reached between the participants concerned. The grant agreement shall lay down time limits in this respect. The other participants may by prior written agreement waive their right to prior notice and to object to transfers of ownership from one participant to a specifically identified third party. 2. Provided that access rights to the results can be exercised, and that any additional exploitation obligations are complied with by the participant which owns the results, the latter may grant licences or otherwise grant the right to exploit them to any legal entity, including on an exclusive basis. Exclusive licences for results may be granted subject to consent by all the other participants concerned that they will waive their access rights thereto. 3. With regard to results which are generated by participants that have received Union funding, the grant agreement may provide that the Commission or the relevant funding body may object to transfers of ownership or to grants of an exclusive licence to third parties established in a third country not associated with Horizon 2020, if it considers that the grant or transfer is not in accordance with the interests of developing the competitiveness of the Union economy, or is inconsistent with ethical principles or security considerations. In such cases, the transfer of ownership or grant of exclusive licence shall not take place unless the Commission or the relevant funding body is satisfied that appropriate safeguards will be put in place. EN 20.12.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 347 99  Where appropriate, the grant agreement shall provide that the Commission or the relevant funding body is to be notified in advance of any such transfer of ownership or grant of an exclusive licence. The grant agreement shall lay down time limits in this respect.
