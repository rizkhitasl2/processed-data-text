I Legislative acts REGULATIONS REGULATION EU No 806 2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 July 2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Reso lution Fund and amending Regulation EU No 1093 2010 THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank 1 , Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 2 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 3 , Whereas 1 Over the past decades the Union has made progress in creating an internal market for banking services. A better integrated internal market for banking services is essential in order to foster economic growth in the Union and adequate funding of the real economy. However, the financial and economic crisis has shown that the functioning of the internal market in this area is under threat and that there is an increasing risk of financial fragmentation. This is a real source of concern in an internal market in which banks should be able to carry out significant cross border activities. Interbank markets have become less liquid and cross border bank activities are decreasing due to fear of contagion, lack of confidence in other national banking systems and in the ability of Member States to support banks. 2 Divergences between national resolution rules in different Member States and corresponding administrative prac tices and the lack of a unified decision making process for resolution in the banking union contribute to that lack of confidence and market instability, as they do not ensure predictability as to the possible outcome of a bank failure. 3 In particular, the different incentives and practices of Member States in the treatment of creditors of banks under resolution and in the bail out of failing banks with tax payers money have an impact on the perceived credit risk, financial soundness and solvency of their banks and thus create an unlevel playing field. This undermines public confidence in the banking sector and obstructs the exercise of the freedom of establishment and the free provi sion of services within the internal market because financing costs would be lower without such differences in practices of Member States. 30.7.2014 L 225 1 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 OJ C 109, 11.4.2014, p. 2. 2 OJ C 67, 6.3.2014, p. 58. 3 Position of the European Parliament of 15 April 2014 not yet published in the Official Journal and decision of the Council of 14 July 2014.   4 Divergences between national resolution rules in different Member States and corresponding administrative prac tices may lead banks and customers to have higher borrowing costs only because of their place of establishment and irrespective of their real creditworthiness. In addition, customers of banks in some Member States face higher borrowing rates than customers of banks in other Member States, irrespective of their own creditworthiness. 5 The European Council on 18 October 2012 concluded that, In the light of the fundamental challenges facing it, the Economic and Monetary Union needs to be strengthened to ensure economic and social welfare as well as stability and sustained prosperity and that the process towards deeper economic and monetary union should build on the Union institutional and legal framework and be characterised by openness and transparency towards Member States whose currency is not the euro and by respect for the integrity of the internal market . To that end a banking union is established, underpinned by a comprehensive and detailed single rulebook for financial services for the internal market as a whole. The process towards establishing a banking union is characterised by openness and transparency towards non participating Member States and by respect for the integrity of the internal market. 6 The European Parliament, in its resolution of 7 July 2010 with recommendations to the Commission on Cross Border Crisis Management in the Banking Sector, requested the Commission to submit on the basis of Articles 50 and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, one or more legislative proposals relating to an EU crisis management framework, an EU financial stability fund, and a resolution unit and, in its resolution of 20 November 2012 with recommendations to the Commission on the report of the Presidents of the Euro pean Council, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union , stated that breaking up the negative feedback loops between sovereigns, banks and the real economy is crucial for a smooth functioning of the EMU , stressed the urgent need for additional and far reaching measures to solve the crisis in the banking sector and for the realisation of a fully operational European banking union while ensuring the continued proper functioning of the internal market for financial services and the free movement of capital . 7 As a first step towards a banking union, the single supervisory mechanism established by Council Regulation EU No 1024 2013 1 the SSM is to ensure that the Union s policy relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions is implemented in a coherent and effective manner, that the single rulebook for financial services is applied in the same manner to credit institutions in the euro area Member States and those non euro area Member States who choose to participate in the SSM the participating Member States , and that those credit institutions are subject to supervision of the highest quality. 8 More efficient resolution mechanisms are an essential instrument to avoid damages that have resulted from fail ures of banks in the past. 9 As long as resolution rules, practices and approaches to burden sharing remain national and the financial resources needed for funding resolution are raised and spent at national level, the internal market will remain fragmented. Moreover, national supervisors have strong incentives to minimise the potential impact of bank crises on their national economies by adopting unilateral action to ring fence banking operations, for instance by limiting intra group transfers and lending, or by imposing higher liquidity and capital requirements on subsidi aries in their jurisdictions of potentially failing parent undertakings. This restricts the cross border activities of banks and thus creates obstacles to the exercise of fundamental freedoms and distorts competition in the internal market. Contentious home host issues, although addressed in the context of SSM and of Directive 2014 59 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 2 , may still reduce efficiency in cross border resolution processes. 30.7.2014 L 225 2 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 Council Regulation EU No 1024 2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions OJ L 287, 29.10.2013, p. 63 . 2 Directive 2014 59 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and reso lution of credit institutions and investment firms and amending Council Directive 82 891 EEC, and Directives 2001 24 EC, 2002 47 EC, 2004 25 EC, 2005 56 EC, 2007 36 EC, 2011 35 EU, 2012 30 EU and 2013 36 EU, and Regulations EU No 1093 2010 and EU No 648 2012, of the European Parliament and of the Council OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 190 .   10 In order to address those issues it has been necessary to intensify the integration of the resolution framework for credit institutions and investment firms institutions in order to bolster the Union, restore financial stability and lay the basis for economic recovery. Directive 2014 59 EU is a significant step towards harmonisation of the rules relating to the resolution of banks across the Union and provides for cooperation among resolution author ities when dealing with the failure of cross border banks. However, that Directive establishes minimum harmoni sation rules and does not lead to centralisation of decision making in the field of resolution. It essentially provides for common resolution tools and resolution powers available for the national authorities of every Member State, but leaves discretion to national authorities in the application of the tools and in the use of national financing arrangements in support of resolution procedures. This ensures that authorities have the tools to intervene suffi ciently early and quickly in an unsound or failing institution so as to ensure the continuity of the institution s critical financial and economic functions while minimising the impact of an institution s failure on the economy and financial system. Although it confers regulatory and mediation tasks on the European Supervisory Authority European Banking Authority EBA , established by Regulation EU No 1093 2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 , Directive 2014 59 EU does not completely avoid the taking of separate and potentially inconsistent decisions by Member States regarding the resolution of cross border groups which may affect the overall costs of resolution. Moreover, as it provides for national financing arrangements, it does not sufficiently reduce the depen dence of banks on the support from national budgets and does not completely prevent different approaches by Member States to the use of the financing arrangements. 11 For participating Member States, in the context of the Single Resolution Mechanism SRM , a centralised power of resolution is established and entrusted to the Single Resolution Board established in accordance with this Regu lation the Board and to the national resolution authorities. That establishment is an integral part of the process of harmonisation in the field of resolution operated by Directive 2014 59 EU and by the set of uniform provi sions on resolution laid down in this Regulation. The uniform application of the resolution regime in the partici pating Member States will be enhanced as a result of it being entrusted to a central authority such as the SRM. Furthermore, the SRM is interwoven with the process of harmonisation in the field of prudential supervision, brought about by the establishment of EBA, the single rulebook on prudential supervision Regulation EU No 575 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 2 and Directive 2013 36 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 3 , and, in the participating Member States, the establishment of the SSM to which the application of Union prudential supervision rules is entrusted. Supervision and resolution are two complementary aspects of the establishment of the internal market for financial services whose application at the same level is regarded as mutually dependent. 12 Ensuring effective resolution decisions for failing banks within the Union, including on the use of funding raised at Union level, is essential for the completion of the internal market in financial services. Within the internal market, the failure of banks in one Member State may affect the stability of the financial markets of the Union as a whole. Ensuring effective and uniform resolution rules and equal conditions of resolution financing across Member States is in the best interests not only of the Member States in which banks operate but also of all Member States in general as a means of ensuring a level competitive playing field and improving the functioning of the internal market. Banking systems in the internal market are highly interconnected, bank groups are interna tional and banks have a large percentage of foreign assets. In the absence of the SRM, bank crises in Member States participating in the SSM would have a stronger negative systemic impact also in non participating Member States. The establishment of the SRM will ensure a neutral approach in dealing with failing banks and therefore increase stability of the banks of the participating Member States and prevent the spill over of crises into non participating Member States and will thus facilitate the functioning of the internal market as a whole. The 30.7.2014 L 225 3 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 Regulation EU No 1093 2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervi sory Authority European Banking Authority , amending Decision No 716 2009 EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009 78 EC OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 12 . 2 Regulation EU No 575 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation EU No 648 2012 OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 1 . 3 Directive 2013 36 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002 87 EC and repealing Directives 2006 48 EC and 2006 49 EC OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338 .  mechanisms for cooperation regarding institutions established in both participating and non participating Member States should be clear, and no Member State or group of Member States should be discriminated against, directly or indirectly, as a venue for financial services. 13 In order to restore trust and credibility in the banking sector, the European Central Bank ECB is currently conducting a comprehensive balance sheet assessment of all banks supervised directly. Such an assessment should assure all stakeholders that banks entering the SSM, and therefore falling within the scope of the SRM, are funda mentally sound and trustworthy. 14 Following the establishment of the SSM by Regulation EU No 1024 2013 pursuant to which banks in the parti cipating Member States are supervised either centrally by the ECB or by the national competent authorities within the framework of the SSM, there is a misalignment between the Union supervision of such banks and the national treatment of those banks in the resolution proceedings pursuant to Directive 2014 59 EU which will be addressed by the establishment of the SRM. 15 This Regulation applies only in respect of banks whose home supervisor is the ECB or the national competent authority in Member States whose currency is the euro or in Member States whose currency is not the euro which have established a close cooperation in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation EU No 1024 2013. The scope of application of this Regulation is linked to the scope of application of Regulation EU No 1024 2013. Indeed, bearing in mind the significant level to which the supervisory tasks attributed to the SSM and resolution action are interwoven, the establishment of a centralised system of supervision operated under Article 127 6 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU is fundamentally important to the process of harmonisation of resolution in participating Member States. The fact of being subject to supervision by the SSM constitutes a specific attribute that places the entities falling within the scope of application of Regulation EU No 1024 2013 in an objectively and characterised distinct position for resolution purposes. It is necessary to adopt measures to create an SRM for all Member States participating in the SSM in order to facilitate the proper and stable functioning of the internal market. 16 Whilst banks in Member States remaining outside the SSM are subject to supervision, resolution and financial backstop arrangements which are aligned at national level, banks in Member States participating in the SSM are subject to Union arrangements for supervision and national arrangements for resolution and financial backstops. Because supervision and resolution are at two different levels within the SSM, intervention and resolution in banks in the Member States participating in the SSM would not be as rapid, consistent and effective as in banks in the Member States outside of the SSM. Therefore, a centralised resolution mechanism for all banks operating in the Member States participating in the SSM is essential to guarantee a level playing field. 17 As long as supervision in a Member State remains outside the SSM, that Member State should remain responsible for the financial consequences of a bank failure. The SRM should therefore extend only to banks and financial institutions established in Member States participating in the SSM and subject to the supervision of the ECB and the national authorities within the framework of the SSM. Banks established in the Member States not partici pating in the SSM should not be subject to the SRM. Subjecting such Member States to the SRM would create the wrong incentives for them. In particular, supervisors in those Member States may become more lenient towards banks in their jurisdictions as they would not have to bear the full financial risk of their failures. Therefore, in order to ensure parallelism with the SSM, the SRM should apply to Member States participating in the SSM. As Member States join the SSM, they should also automatically become subject to the SRM. Ultimately, the SRM could potentially extend to the entire internal market. 30.7.2014 L 225 4 Official Journal of the European Union EN   18 In order to ensure a level playing field within the internal market as a whole, this Regulation is consistent with Directive 2014 59 EU. It therefore adapts the rules and principles of that Directive to the specificities of the SRM and ensures that appropriate funding is available to the latter. When the Board, the Council and the Commission exercise the powers conferred on them by this Regulation, they should be subject to the delegated acts, and regu latory and implementing technical standards, guidelines and recommendations adopted by EBA on the basis of re spectively Articles 10 to 15 and Article 16 of Regulation EU No 1093 2010 within the scope of Directive 2014 59 EU. The Board, the Council and the Commission, in their respective capacities, should also cooperate with EBA in accordance with Articles 25 and 30 of Regulation EU No 1093 2010 and respond to requests of collection of information addressed to them by EBA in accordance with Article 35 of that Regulation. It is recalled that, according to the last sentence of Recital 32 of that Regulation, in cases where the relevant Union legislation confers discretion on competent authorities, decisions taken by the Authority cannot replace the exercise in compliance with Union law of that discretion . The same principle should extend to this Regulation, while fully respecting the principles enshrined in primary Union law. In the light of those key elements EBA should be able to perform its tasks effectively and to secure the equality of treatment between the Board, the Council, the Commission and the national authorities when performing similar tasks. 19 A single resolution fund Fund is an essential element without which the SRM could not work properly. If the funding of resolution were to remain national in the longer term, the link between sovereigns and the banking sector would not be fully broken, and investors would continue to establish borrowing conditions according to the place of establishment of the banks rather than to their creditworthiness. The Fund should help to ensure a uniform administrative practice in the financing of resolution and to avoid the creation of obstacles for the exer cise of fundamental freedoms or the distortion of competition in the internal market due to divergent national practices. The Fund should be financed by bank contributions raised at national level and should be pooled at Union level in accordance with an intergovernmental agreement on the transfer and progressive mutualisation of those contributions the Agreement , thus increasing financial stability and limiting the link between the perceived fiscal position of individual Member States and the funding costs of banks and undertakings operating in those Member States. To further break that link, decisions taken within the SRM should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of the Member States. In that regard, only extraordinary public financial support should be considered to be an impingement on the budgetary sovereignty and fiscal responsibilities of the Member States. In particular, decisions that require the use of the Fund or of a deposit guarantee scheme should not be consid ered to impinge on the budgetary sovereignty or fiscal responsibilities of the Member States. 20 This Regulation, together with Directive 2014 59 EU, establishes the modalities for the use of the Fund and the general criteria to determine the fixing and calculation of ex ante and ex post contributions. Participating Member States remain competent to levy the contributions from the entities located in their respective territories in accordance with Directive 2014 59 EU and with this Regulation. By means of the Agreement, the participating Member States will assume the obligation to transfer to the Fund the contributions that they raise at national level in accordance with Directive 2014 59 EU and this Regulation. During a transitional period, the contribu tions will be allocated to different compartments corresponding to each participating Member State national compartments . Those compartments will be subject to a progressive merger so that they will cease to exist at the end of the transitional period. The Agreement will lay down the conditions upon which the parties thereto agree to transfer the contributions that they raise at national level to the Fund and to progressively merge the compart ments. The entry into force of the Agreement will be necessary for the contributions raised by the parties to be transferred to the national compartments of the Fund. This Regulation lays down the powers of the Board for using and managing the Fund. The Agreement will determine how the Board is able to dispose of the national compartments that are progressively merged. 21 A centralised application of the resolution rules for institutions laid down in Directive 2014 59 EU by a single Union resolution authority in the participating Member States can be ensured only where the rules governing the establishment and functioning of the SRM are directly applicable in the Member States to avoid divergent inter pretations across the Member States. Such direct applicability should bring benefits to the internal market as a whole because it will contribute to ensuring fair competition and to preventing obstacles to the free exercise of fundamental freedoms not only in the participating Member States but in the internal market as a whole. 22 Mirroring the scope of Regulation EU No 1024 2013, the SRM should cover all credit institutions established in the participating Member States. However, within the framework of the SRM, it should be possible to resolve directly any credit institution of a participating Member State in order to avoid asymmetries within the internal 30.7.2014 L 225 5 Official Journal of the European Union EN  market in respect of the treatment of failing institutions and creditors during a resolution process. To the extent that parent undertakings, investment firms and financial institutions are included in the consolidated supervision by the ECB, they should be included in the scope of the SRM. Although the ECB will not supervise those institu tions on a solo basis, it will be the only supervisor that will have a global perception of the risk which a group, and indirectly its individual members, is exposed to. To exclude entities which form part of the consolidated supervision within the scope of the ECB from the scope of the SRM would make it impossible to plan for the resolution of groups and to adopt a group resolution strategy, and would make any resolution decisions much less effective. 23 Within the SRM, decisions should be taken at the most appropriate level. When adopting decisions under this Regulation, the Board and the national resolution authorities should apply the same material rules. 24 Since only institutions of the Union may establish the resolution policy of the Union and since a margin of discretion remains in the adoption of each specific resolution scheme, it is necessary to provide for the adequate involvement of the Council and the Commission, as institutions which may exercise implementing powers, in accordance with Article 291 TFEU. The assessment of the discretionary aspects of the resolution decisions taken by the Board should be exercised by the Commission. Given the considerable impact of the resolution decisions on the financial stability of Member States and on the Union as such, as well as on the fiscal sovereignty of Member States, it is important that implementing power to take certain decisions relating to resolution be conferred on the Council. It should therefore be for the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, to exercise effective control on the assessment by the Board of the existence of a public interest and to assess any material change to the amount of the Fund to be used in a specific resolution action. Moreover, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts to specify further criteria or conditions to be taken into account by the Board in the exercise of its different powers. Such a conferral of resolution tasks should not in any way hamper the functioning of the internal market for financial services. EBA should therefore maintain its role and retain its existing powers and tasks it should develop and contribute to the consistent application of the Union legislation applicable to all Member States and enhance convergence of resolution practices across the Union as a whole. 25 In order to ensure conformity with the principles established in Article 3 3 of Directive 2014 59 EU, the Union institutions, when performing the tasks conferred on them by this Regulation, should ensure that appropriate organisational arrangements are in place. 26 The ECB, as the supervisor within the SSM, and the Board, should be able to assess whether a credit institution is failing or is likely to fail and whether there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector or super visory action would prevent its failure within a reasonable timeframe. The Board, if it considers all the criteria relating to the triggering of resolutions to be met, should adopt the resolution scheme. The procedure relating to the adoption of the resolution scheme, which involves the Commission and the Council, strengthens the neces sary operational independence of the Board while respecting the principle of delegation of powers to agencies as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union the Court of Justice . Therefore, this Regulation provides that the resolution scheme adopted by the Board enters into force only if, within 24 hours after its adop tion by the Board, there are no objections from the Council or the Commission or the resolution scheme is approved by the Commission. The grounds on which the Council is permitted to object, on a proposal by the Commission, to the Board s resolution scheme should be strictly limited to the existence of a public interest and to material modifications by the Commission of the amount of the use of the Fund as proposed by the Board. A change of 5 or more to the amount of the Fund compared with the original proposal of the Board should be considered to be material. The Council should approve or object to the Commission s proposal without amending it. As an observer to the meetings of the Board, the Commission should, on an ongoing basis, check that the resolution scheme adopted by the Board complies fully with this Regulation, balances appropriately the different objectives and interests at stake, respects the public interest and that the integrity of the internal market is preserved. Considering that the resolution action requires a very speedy decision making process, the Council and the Commission should cooperate closely and the Council should not duplicate the preparatory work already undertaken by the Commission. The Board should instruct the national resolution authorities which should take all necessary measures to implement the resolution scheme. 30.7.2014 L 225 6 Official Journal of the European Union EN   27 The production of a group resolution scheme should facilitate coordinated resolution that is more likely to deliver the best result for all entities of a group. The Board or, where relevant, the national resolution authorities should have the power to apply the bridge institution tool at group level which may involve, where appropriate, burden sharing arrangements to stabilise a group as a whole. Ownership of subsidiaries could be transferred to the bridge institution with a view to onward sale, either as a package or individually, when market conditions are appropriate. In addition, the Board or, where relevant, the national resolution authority should have the power to apply the bail in tool at parent level. 28 The Board should, in particular, be empowered to take decisions in relation to significant entities or groups, enti ties or groups directly supervised by the ECB or cross border groups. The national resolution authorities should assist the Board in resolution planning and in the preparation of resolution decisions. For entities and groups which are not significant and not cross border, the national resolution authorities should be responsible, in par ticular, for resolution planning, the assessment of resolvability, the removal of impediments to resolvability, the measures that the resolution authorities are entitled to take during early intervention, and resolution actions. Under certain circumstances the national resolution authorities should perform their tasks on the basis of and in accordance with this Regulation while exercising the powers conferred on them by, and in accordance with, the national law transposing Directive 2014 59 EU in so far as it is not in conflict with this Regulation. 29 It is essential for the good functioning of the internal market that the same rules apply to all resolution actions, regardless of whether they are taken by the resolution authorities under Directive 2014 59 EU or within the framework of the SRM. The Commission should assess those measures under Article 107 TFEU. 30 Where resolution action would involve the granting of State aid pursuant to Article 107 1 TFEU or as Fund aid, a resolution decision can be adopted after the Commission has adopted a positive or conditional decision concerning the compatibility of the use of such aid with the internal market. The decision of the Commission on Fund aid may impose conditions, commitments or undertakings in respect of the beneficiary. The conditions which may be imposed by the Commission may include, but are not limited to, burden sharing requirements, including a requirement that losses are first absorbed by equity, and requirements as to contributions by hybrid capital holders, subordinated debt holders and senior creditors, including in accordance with the requirements of Directive 2014 59 EU restrictions on the payment of dividends on shares or coupons on hybrid capital instru ments, on the repurchase of own shares or hybrid capital instruments, or on capital management transactions restrictions on acquisitions of stakes in any undertaking either through an asset or share transfer prohibitions against aggressive commercial practices or strategies, or advertising support from public aid requirements concerning market shares, pricing, product features or other behavioural requirements requirements for restruc turing plans governance requirements reporting and disclosure requirements, including as regards compliance with such conditions as may be specified by the Commission requirements relating to the sale of the beneficiary or of all or part of its assets, rights and liabilities requirements relating to the liquidation of the beneficiary. 31 In order to ensure a swift and effective decision making process in resolution, the Board should be a specific Union agency with a specific structure, corresponding to its specific tasks, and which departs from the model of all other agencies of the Union. Its composition should ensure that due account is taken of all relevant interests at stake in resolution procedures. Taking into account the missions of the Board, a Chair, a Vice Chair and four further full time members of the Board should be appointed on the basis of merit, skills, knowledge of banking and financial matters, and experience relevant to financial supervision, regulation and resolution of institutions. The Chair, the Vice Chair and the four further full time members of the Board should be chosen on the basis of an open selection procedure of which the European Parliament and the Council should be kept duly informed and which should respect the principle of gender balance, experience and qualification. The Commission should provide the competent committee of the European Parliament with the shortlist of candidates for the positions of Chair, Vice Chair and the four further full time members of the Board. The Commission should submit a proposal for the appointment of the Chair, the Vice Chair and the four further full time members of the Board to 30.7.2014 L 225 7 Official Journal of the European Union EN  the European Parliament for approval. Following the European Parliament s approval of that proposal, the Council should adopt an implementing decision to appoint the Chair, the Vice Chair and the four further full time members of the Board. 32 The Board should operate in executive and plenary sessions. In its executive session, it should be composed of its Chair, its four further independent full time members, which should act independently and objectively in the interest of the Union as a whole, and permanent observers appointed by the Commission and by the ECB. When deliberating on the resolution of an institution or group established within a single participating Member State, the executive session of the Board should convene and involve in the decision making process the member appointed by the Member State concerned representing its national resolution authority. When deliberating on a cross border group, the members appointed by the home and all host Member States concerned representing the relevant national resolution authorities should be convened and involved in the decision making process of the executive session of the Board. 33 The Board, in its executive session, should prepare all decisions concerning resolution procedure and, to the fullest extent possible, adopt those decisions. Because of the institution specific nature of the information contained in the resolution plans, decisions concerning the drawing up, assessment, and approval of the reso lution plans should be taken by the Board in its executive session. Regarding the use of the Fund, it is important that there is no first mover advantage and that the outflows of the Fund are monitored. In order to ensure corre sponding decision making by the Board, where resolution action is required above the threshold of EUR 5 000 000 000, any member of the plenary should be able, within a strict deadline, to request that the plenary session decide. Where liquidity support involves no or significantly less risk than other forms of support, in particular in the case of a short term, one off extension of credit to solvent institutions against adequate collat eral of high quality, it is justified to give such a form of support a lower weight of only 0,5. Once the net accu mulated use of the Fund in the previous consecutive 12 months reaches the threshold of EUR 5 000 000 000 per year, the plenary session should evaluate the application of the resolution tools, including the use of the Fund, and should provide guidance which the executive session should follow in subsequent resolution decisions. Guidance to the executive session should, in particular, focus on ensuring the non discriminatory application of resolution tools, on avoiding a depletion of the Fund and differentiating appropriately between no risk or low risk liquidity and other forms of support. 34 Since the participants in the decision making process of the Board in its executive sessions would change depending on the Member State where the relevant institution or group operates, the permanent participants should ensure that the decisions throughout the different formations of the executive sessions of the Board are consistent, appropriate and proportionate. 35 The Board should be able to invite observers to its meetings. The conferral of resolution tasks on the Board should be consistent with the framework of the European System of Financial Supervision ESFS and its under lying objective to develop the single rulebook and enhance convergence of supervisory and resolution practices across the Union as a whole. In particular, EBA should assess and coordinate initiatives, in accordance with Regu lation EU No 1093 2010, on resolution plans with a view to promoting convergence in that area. Therefore, as a general rule, the Board should always invite EBA when matters are discussed for which, in accordance with Dir ective 2014 59 EU, EBA is required to develop technical standards or to issue guidelines. Other observers, such as a representative of the European Stability Mechanism ESM , may, where appropriate, also be invited to attend the meetings of the Board. 36 The observers should be subject to the same requirements of professional secrecy as the members and the staff of the Board and staff exchanged with or seconded by participating Member States carrying out resolution duties. 37 The Board should be able to establish internal resolution teams composed of its own staff and staff of the national resolution authorities, including, where appropriate, observers from non participating Member States. Those internal resolution teams should be headed by coordinators appointed from the Board s senior staff, who might be invited as observers to participate in the executive sessions of the Board. 30.7.2014 L 225 8 Official Journal of the European Union EN   38 The Board and the resolution authorities and competent authorities of the non participating Member States should conclude memoranda of understanding describing in general terms how they will cooperate with one another in the performance of their tasks under Directive 2014 59 EU. The memoranda of understanding could, inter alia, clarify the consultation relating to decisions of the Board that have effect on subsidiaries established or branches located in the non participating Member States, where the parent undertaking is established in a partici pating Member State. The memoranda should be reviewed on a regular basis. 39 The Board should act independently. It should have the capacity to deal with large groups and to act swiftly and impartially. The Board should ensure that appropriate account is taken of national financial stability, financial stability of the Union and the internal market. Members of the Board should have the necessary expertise on bank restructuring and insolvency. 40 When making decisions or taking actions in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Regulation, due account should be given to the importance for the internal market of the exercise of the right of establishment provided for in the TFEU, and, in particular, where possible, to the effects on the continuation of cross border activities. 41 In the light of the Board s missions and the resolution objectives which include the protection of public funds, the functioning of the SRM should be financed from contributions paid by the institutions established in the participating Member States. 42 The Board, the Council where relevant, and the Commission should replace the national resolution authorities designated under Directive 2014 59 EU in respect of all aspects relating to the resolution decision making process. The national resolution authorities designated under that Directive should continue to carry out activities relating to the implementation of resolution schemes adopted by the Board. In order to ensure transparency and democratic control, as well as to safeguard the rights of the Union institutions, the Board should be accountable to the European Parliament and to the Council for any decisions taken on the basis of this Regulation. For reasons of transparency and democratic control, national parliaments should have certain rights to obtain infor mation about the activities of, and to engage in a dialogue with, the Board. 43 The national parliament of a participating Member State, or the competent committee thereof, should be able to invite the Chair to participate in an exchange of views in relation to the resolution of institutions in that Member State together with a representative of the national resolution authority. Such a role for national parliaments is appropriate given the potential impact that resolution actions may have on public finances, institutions, their cus tomers and employees, and the markets in the participating Member States. The Chair and the national resolution authorities should respond positively to such invitations to exchange views with the national parliaments. 44 To ensure a uniform approach for institutions and groups the Board should be empowered to draw up resolution plans for such institutions and groups, after consulting the national competent and resolution authorities. It should be the general rule that the group resolution plans are prepared for the group as a whole and identify measures in relation to a parent undertaking as well as all individual subsidiaries that are part of a group. The group resolution plans should take into account the financial, technical and business structure of the relevant group. If individual resolution plans for entities that are a part of a group are prepared, the Board or, where rele vant, the national resolution authorities should aim to achieve, to the extent possible, consistency with resolution plans for the rest of the group. The Board or, where relevant, the national resolution authorities should transmit the resolution plans and any changes thereto to the competent authority, in order to permanently keep it fully informed. The Board should assess the resolvability of institutions and groups, and take measures aimed at removing impediments to resolvability, if any. The Board should require the national resolution authorities to apply such appropriate measures designed to remove impediments to resolvability in order to ensure consistency and the resolvability of the institutions concerned. Given the sensitivity of the information contained in them, resolution plans should be subject to the requirements of professional secrecy laid down in this Regulation. 30.7.2014 L 225 9 Official Journal of the European Union EN   45 When applying resolution tools and exercising resolution powers, the principle of proportionality and the parti cularities of the legal form of an institution should be taken into account. 46 Resolution planning is an essential component of effective resolution. The Board should therefore have the power to require changes to the structure and organisation of institutions or groups to take measures which are neces sary and proportionate to reduce or remove material impediments to the application of resolution tools and ensure the resolvability of the entities concerned. Due to the potentially systemic nature of all institutions, it is crucial, in order to maintain financial stability, that the Board, or, where relevant, the national resolution author ities, have the possibility to resolve any institution. In order to respect the right to conduct business laid down by Article 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union the Charter , the Board s discretion should be limited to what is necessary to simplify the structure and operations of the institution solely to improve its resolvability. In addition, any measure imposed for such purposes should be consistent with Union law. Measures should neither directly nor indirectly be discriminatory on grounds of nationality, and should be justified by the overriding reason of being conducted in the public interest in financial stability. To determine whether an action was taken in the general public interest, the Board, acting in the general public interest, should be able to achieve the resolution objectives without encountering impediments to the application of resolution tools or its ability to exercise the powers conferred on it by this Regulation. Furthermore, action should not go beyond the minimum necessary to attain the objectives sought. When determining the measures to be taken, the Board or, where applicable, the national resolution authorities should take into account the warnings and recom mendations of the European Systemic Risk Board ESRB established by Regulation EU No 1092 2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 . 47 Due to the potentially systemic nature of all institutions, it is crucial that the Board, where appropriate in co operation with the national resolution authorities, is able to adopt resolution plans, assess the resolvability of any institution and group and, where necessary, take measures to address or remove impediments to the resolvability of any institution in the participating Member States. The failure of systemically important institutions, including those referred to in Article 131 of Directive 2013 36 EU, could pose a considerable risk to the functioning of the financial markets and could have a negative impact on financial stability. The Board should take due care, as a matter of priority, to establish the resolution plans of those systemically important institutions, as well as to assess their resolvability and to take all action necessary to address or remove all of the impediments to their resolvability, without prejudice to its independence and to its obligation to plan for the resolution and assess the resolvability of all of the institutions subject to its powers. 48 Resolution plans should include procedures for informing and consulting employee representatives throughout the resolution processes where appropriate. Where applicable, collective agreements or other arrangements provided for by social partners, as well as by Union and national law on the involvement of trade unions and workers representatives in company restructuring processes, should be complied with in that regard. 49 In relation to the obligation of drafting resolution plans, the Board, or, where relevant, the national resolution authorities, in the context of resolution plans and when using the different powers and tools at their disposal, should take into account the nature of an entity s business, shareholding structure, legal form, risk profile, size and legal status and interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general, the scope and complexity of its activities, whether it is a member of an institutional protection scheme IPS or other coopera tive mutual solidarity systems, whether it exercises any investment services or activities and whether its failure and subsequent winding up under normal insolvency proceedings would be likely to have a significant negative effect on financial markets, on other institutions, on funding conditions, or on the wider economy, ensuring that the regime is applied in an appropriate and proportionate way and that the administrative burden relating to resolution plan preparation obligations is minimised. Whereas the contents and information specified in Section A of the Annex to Directive 2014 59 EU establish a minimum standard for entities with evident systemic rele vance, it is permitted to apply different or significantly reduced resolution planning and information requirements on an institution specific basis, and at a lower frequency for updates than one year. For a small entity of little interconnectedness and complexity, the resolution plan could be reduced. Further, the regime should be applied 30.7.2014 L 225 10 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 Regulation EU No 1092 2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on European Union macro prudential oversight of the financial system and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 1 .  so as not to jeopardise the stability of financial markets. In particular, in situations characterised by broader problems or even doubts about the resilience of many entities, it is essential to consider the risk of contagion from the actions taken in relation to any individual entity. 50 Where Directive 2014 59 EU provides for the possibility of applying simplified obligations or waivers by the national resolution authorities in relation to the requirement of drafting resolution plans, a procedure should be provided for whereby the Board or, where relevant, the national resolution authorities could authorise the appli cation of such simplified obligations. 51 In line with the capital structure of entities affiliated to a central body, for the purposes of this Regulation, the Board, or, where relevant, the national resolution authorities, should not be obliged to draw up separate reso lution plans solely on the grounds that the central body to which those entities are affiliated is under direct super vision of the ECB. In the case of group resolution plans, the potential impact of the resolution actions in all the Member States where the group operates should be specifically taken into account in the drawing up of the plans. 52 The SRM should be based on the frameworks of Regulation EU No 1024 2013 and of Directive 2014 59 EU. Therefore, the Board should be empowered to intervene at an early stage where the financial situation or the solvency of an entity is deteriorating. The information that the Board receives from the national resolution authorities or the ECB at that stage is instrumental in making a determination on the action it might take in order to prepare for the resolution of the entity concerned. 53 In order to ensure rapid resolution action when it becomes necessary, the Board should closely monitor, in co operation with the ECB or with the relevant national competent authority, the situation of the entities concerned and the compliance of those entities with any early intervention measure taken in their respect. In determining whether a private sector action could prevent within a reasonable timeframe the failure of an entity, the appro priate authority should take into account the effectiveness of early intervention measures undertaken within a timeframe set by the competent authority. 54 The Board, the national resolution authorities and the competent authorities, including the ECB, should, where necessary, conclude a memorandum of understanding describing in general terms how they will cooperate with one another in the performance of their respective tasks under Union law. The memorandum should be reviewed on a regular basis. 55 When making decisions or taking actions, in particular regarding entities established both in participating Member States and in non participating Member States, possible adverse effects on those Member States, such as threats to the financial stability of their financial markets, and on the entities established in those Member States, should also be taken into consideration. 56 In order to minimise disruption of the financial market and of the economy, the resolution process should be accomplished in a short time. Depositors should be granted access at least to the guaranteed deposits as promptly as possible, and in any event within the same deadlines as provided for in Directive 2014 49 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 . The Commission should, throughout the resolution procedure, have access to any information which it deems to be necessary to take an informed decision in the resolution process. 57 The decision to place an entity under resolution should be taken before a financial entity is balance sheet insol vent and before all equity has been fully wiped out. Resolution should be initiated after the determination that an entity is failing or is likely to fail and that no alternative private sector measures would prevent such failure within a reasonable timeframe. The fact that an entity does not meet the requirements for authorisation should not justify per se the entry into resolution, especially if the entity remains or is likely to remain viable. An entity should be considered to be failing or likely to fail where it infringes or is likely, in the near future, to infringe the 30.7.2014 L 225 11 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 Directive 2014 49 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on deposit guarantee schemes OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 149 .  requirements for continuing authorisation, where the assets of the entity are, or are likely in the near future to be, less than its liabilities, where the entity is, or is likely in the near future to be, unable to pay its debts as they fall due, or where the entity requires extraordinary public financial support except in the particular circumstances laid down in this Regulation. The need for emergency liquidity assistance from a central bank should not, per se, be a condition that sufficiently demonstrates that an entity is, or is likely in the near future to be, unable to pay its liabilities as they fall due. If that facility were guaranteed by a State, an entity accessing such a facility would be subject to State aid rules. In order to preserve financial stability, in particular in the event of a systemic liquidity shortage, State guarantees of liquidity facilities provided by central banks or State guarantees of newly issued liabilities to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State should not trigger the reso lution framework provided that a number of conditions are met. In particular, the State guarantee measures should be approved under the State aid framework and should not be part of a larger aid package, and the use of the guarantee measures should be strictly limited in time. Member States guarantees for equity claims should be prohibited. When providing a guarantee, a Member State should ensure that the guarantee is sufficiently remunerated by the entity. Furthermore, the provision of extraordinary public financial support should not trigger resolution where, as a precautionary measure, a Member State takes an equity stake in an entity, including an entity which is publicly owned, which complies with its capital requirements. That may be the case, for example, where an entity is required to raise new capital due to the outcome of a scenario based stress test or of the equivalent exercise conducted by macroprudential authorities which includes a requirement that is set to maintain financial stability in the context of a systemic crisis, but the entity is unable to raise capital privately in markets. An entity should not be considered to be failing or likely to fail solely on the basis that extraordinary public financial support was provided before the entry into force of this Regulation. Finally, access to liquidity facilities including emergency liquidity assistance by central banks may constitute State aid pursuant to the State aid framework. 58 Liquidation of a failing entity under normal insolvency proceedings could jeopardise financial stability, interrupt the provision of essential services, and affect the protection of depositors. In such a case there is a public interest in applying resolution tools. The objectives of resolution should therefore be to ensure the continuity of essential financial services, to maintain the stability of the financial system, to reduce moral hazard by minimising reliance on public financial support to failing entities, and to protect depositors. 59 However, the winding up of an insolvent entity through normal insolvency proceedings should always be consid ered before a decision is taken to maintain the entity as a going concern. An insolvent entity should be main tained as a going concern for financial stability purposes and with the use, to the extent possible, of private funds. That may be achieved either through sale to or merger with a private sector purchaser, or after having written down the liabilities of the entity, or after converting its debt to equity in order to effect a recapitalisation. 60 When taking or preparing decisions relating to resolution powers, the Board, the Council and the Commission should ensure that resolution action is taken in accordance with certain principles, including that shareholders and creditors bear an appropriate share of the losses, that the management should in principle be replaced, that the costs of the resolution of the entity are minimised, and that creditors of the same class are treated in an equi table manner. In particular, where creditors within the same class are treated differently in the context of reso lution action, such distinctions should be justified in the public interest and should be neither directly nor indir ectly discriminatory on the grounds of nationality. 61 The limitations on the rights of shareholders and creditors should comply with Article 52 of the Charter. The resolution tools should therefore be applied only to those entities that are failing or likely to fail, and only where necessary to pursue the objective of financial stability in the general interest. In particular, resolution tools should be applied where the entity cannot be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings without destabilising the financial system and the measures are necessary in order to ensure the rapid transfer and continuation of systemi cally important functions and where there is no reasonable prospect for any alternative private solution, including any increase of capital by the existing shareholders or by any third party, sufficient to restore the full viability of the entity. 30.7.2014 L 225 12 Official Journal of the European Union EN   62 Interference with property rights should not be disproportionate. As a consequence, affected shareholders and creditors should not incur greater losses than those which they would have incurred had the entity been wound up at the time that the resolution decision is taken. In the event of partial transfer of assets of an institution under resolution to a private purchaser or to a bridge institution, the residual part of the institution under reso lution should be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. In order to protect shareholders and creditors of the entity during the winding up proceedings, they should be entitled to receive in payment of their claims not less than what it is estimated they would have recovered if the entity as a whole had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. 63 For the purpose of protecting the rights of shareholders and creditors, clear obligations should be laid down concerning the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the institution under resolution and, where required under this Regulation, the valuation of the treatment that shareholders and creditors would have received if the entity had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. It should be possible to commence a valuation already in the early intervention phase. Before any resolution action is taken, a fair, prudent and realistic valuation of the assets and liabilities of the entity should be carried out. Such valuation should be subject to a right of appeal only together with the resolution decision. In addition, where required under this Regulation, an ex post comparison between the treatment that shareholders and creditors have received and the treatment they would have received under normal insolvency proceedings should be carried out after resolution tools have been applied. If it is determined that shareholders and creditors have received, in payment of their claims, less than the amount that they would have received under normal insolvency proceedings, they should be entitled to the payment of the difference where required under this Regulation. That difference, if any, should be paid by the Fund established in accordance with this Regulation. 64 It is important that losses be recognised upon failure of the entity. The valuation of assets and liabilities of failing entities should be based on fair, prudent and realistic assumptions at the moment when the resolution tools are applied. The value of liabilities should not, however, be affected in the valuation by the entity s financial state. It should be possible, for reasons of urgency, that the Board makes a rapid valuation of the assets or the liabilities of a failing entity. That valuation should be provisional and should apply until an independent valuation is carried out. 65 In order to ensure that the resolution process remains objective and certain, it is necessary to lay down the order in which unsecured claims of creditors against an institution under resolution should be written down or converted. In order to limit the risk of creditors incurring greater losses than if the institution had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings, the order to be laid down should be applicable both in normal in solvency proceedings and in the write down or conversion process under resolution. This would also facilitate the pricing of debt. 66 The Board should decide on the detailed resolution scheme. The relevant resolution tools should include the sale of business tool, the bridge institution tool, the bail in tool and the asset separation tool, which are also provided for in Directive 2014 59 EU. The scheme should also make it possible to assess whether the conditions for the write down and conversion of capital instruments are met. 67 When taking resolution actions, the Board should take into account and follow the measures provided for in the resolution plans unless the Board assesses, taking into account the circumstances of the case, that resolution ob jectives will be achieved more effectively by taking actions which are not provided for in those resolution plans. 68 The resolution tools should include the sale of the business or shares of the institution under resolution, the setting up of a bridge entity, the separation of the performing assets from the impaired or under performing assets of the failing entity, and the bail in of the shareholders and creditors of the failing entity. 30.7.2014 L 225 13 Official Journal of the European Union EN   69 Where the resolution tools have been used to transfer the systemically important services or viable business of an entity to a sound entity such as a private sector purchaser or bridge entity, the residual part of the entity should be liquidated. 70 The sale of business tool should enable the sale of the entity or parts of its business to one or more purchasers without the consent of shareholders. 71 Any net proceeds from the transfer of assets or liabilities of the institution under resolution when applying the sale of business tool should benefit the entity left in the winding up proceedings. Any net proceeds from the transfer of instruments of ownership issued by the institution under resolution when applying the sale of business tool should benefit the owners of those instruments of ownership in the entity left in the winding up proceed ings. Proceeds should be calculated net of the costs arisen from the failure of the entity and from the resolution process. 72 The asset separation tool should enable authorities to transfer assets, rights or liabilities of an institution under resolution to a separate vehicle. That tool should be used only in conjunction with other tools to prevent an undue competitive advantage for the failing entity. 73 An effective resolution regime should minimise the costs of the resolution of a failing entity borne by the taxpayers. It should also ensure that systemic entities can be resolved without jeopardising financial stability. The bail in tool achieves that objective by ensuring that shareholders and creditors of the failing entity suffer appro priate losses and bear an appropriate part of the costs arising from the failure of the entity. The bail in tool will therefore give shareholders and creditors of entities a stronger incentive to monitor the health of an entity during normal circumstances. It also meets the Financial Stability Board recommendation that statutory debt write down and conversion powers be included in a framework for resolution, as an additional option in conjunction with other resolution tools. 74 In order to ensure the necessary flexibility to allocate losses to creditors in a range of circumstances, it is appro priate that the bail in tool be applicable both where the objective is to resolve the failing entity as a going concern if there is a realistic prospect that the entity viability may be restored, and where systemically important services are transferred to a bridge entity and the residual part of the entity ceases to operate and is wound down. 75 Where the bail in tool is applied with the objective of restoring the capital of the failing entity to enable it to continue to operate as a going concern, the resolution through bail in should be accompanied by replacement of management, except where retention of management is appropriate and necessary for the achievement of the resolution objectives, and a subsequent restructuring of the entity and its activities in a way that addresses the reasons for its failure. That restructuring should be achieved through the implementation of a business reorgani sation plan. Where applicable, such plans should be compatible with the restructuring plan that the entity is required to submit to the Commission under the Union State aid framework. In particular, in addition to measures aiming at restoring the long term viability of the entity, the plan should include measures limiting the aid to the minimum burden sharing, and measures limiting distortions of competition. 76 It is not appropriate to apply the bail in tool to claims in so far as they are secured, collateralised or otherwise guaranteed. However, in order to ensure that the bail in tool is effective and achieves its objectives, it is desirable that it can be applied to as wide a range of the unsecured liabilities of a failing entity as possible. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to exclude certain kinds of unsecured liability from the scope of application of the bail in tool. In order to protect holders of covered deposits, the bail in tool should not apply to those deposits that are protected under Directive 2014 49 EU. In order to ensure continuity of critical functions, the bail in tool should not apply to certain liabilities to employees of the failing entity or to commercial claims that relate to goods and services critical for the daily functioning of the entity. In order to honour pension entitlements and pension amounts 30.7.2014 L 225 14 Official Journal of the European Union EN  owed or owing to pension trusts and pension trustees, the bail in tool should not apply to the failing entity s liabilities to a pension scheme, except for liabilities for pension benefits attributable to variable remuneration which do not arise from collective bargaining agreements. To reduce risk to systemic contagion, the bail in tool should not apply to liabilities arising from a participation in payment systems which have a remaining maturity of less than seven days, or liabilities to entities, excluding entities that are part of the same group, with an original maturity of less than seven days. 77 It should be possible to exclude or partially exclude liabilities in a number of circumstances, including where it is not possible to bail in such liabilities within a reasonable timeframe, where the exclusion is strictly necessary and is proportionate to achieving the continuity of critical functions and core business lines, or where the application of the bail in tool to liabilities would cause a destruction in value such that losses borne by other creditors would be higher than if those liabilities were not excluded from bail in. It should also be possible to exclude or partially exclude liabilities where necessary to avoid the spreading of contagion and financial instability which may cause serious disturbance to the economy of a Member State. When carrying out the assessments, the Board or, where relevant, the national resolution authorities should give consideration to the consequences of a potential bail in of liabilities stemming from eligible deposits held by natural persons and micro, small and medium sized enter prises above the coverage level provided for in Directive 2014 49 EU. 78 Where those exclusions are applied, the level of write down or conversion of other eligible liabilities may be increased to take account of such exclusions subject to the no creditor worse off than under normal insolvency proceedings principle being respected. Where the losses cannot be passed to other creditors, the Fund may make a contribution to the institution under resolution subject to a number of strict conditions including the require ment that losses totalling not less than 8 of total liabilities including own funds have already been absorbed, and the funding provided by the Fund is limited to the lower of 5 of total liabilities including own funds or the means available to the Fund and the amount that can be raised through ex post contributions within three years. 79 In extraordinary circumstances, where liabilities have been excluded and the Fund has been used to contribute to bail in in lieu of those liabilities up to the permissible cap, the Board should be able to seek funding from alterna tive funding means. 80 The minimum amount of bail in of 8 of total liabilities referred to in this Regulation should be calculated based on the valuation conducted in accordance with this Regulation. Historical losses which have already been absorbed by shareholders through a reduction in own funds prior to that valuation should not be included in that percentage. 81 As the protection of covered depositors is one of the most important objectives of resolution, covered deposits should not be subject to the exercise of the bail in tool. The deposit guarantee scheme, however, contributes to funding the resolution process by absorbing losses to the extent of the net losses that it would have had to suffer after compensating depositors in normal insolvency proceedings. The exercise of the bail in powers would ensure that depositors continue to have access to their deposits which is the main reason why the deposit guarantee schemes have been established. Not providing for the involvement of those schemes in such cases would consti tute an unfair advantage with respect to the remaining creditors which would be subject to the exercise of the powers by the resolution authority. 82 Where deposits are transferred to another entity in the context of the resolution of an entity, depositors should not be insured beyond the coverage level provided for in Directive 2014 49 EU. Therefore, claims with regard to deposits remaining in the institution under resolution should be limited to the difference between the funds trans ferred and the coverage level provided for in Directive 2014 49 EU. Where transferred deposits are superior to the coverage level, the depositor should have no claim against the deposit guarantee scheme with regard to deposits remaining in the institution under resolution. 83 To avoid entities structuring their liabilities in a manner that impedes the effectiveness of the bail in tool, it is appropriate to establish that the entities should meet at all times a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities which may be subject to the bail in tool, expressed as a percentage of the total liabilities and own funds of the entity. 30.7.2014 L 225 15 Official Journal of the European Union EN   84 A top down approach should be adopted when determining the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities within a group. That approach should recognise that resolution action is applied at the level of the individual legal entity, and that it is imperative that loss absorbing capacity is located in, or is accessible to, the entity within the group where losses occur. To that end, it should be ensured that loss absorbing capacity within a group is distributed across the group in accordance with the level of risk in its constituent legal entities. The minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities necessary for each individual subsidiary should be separately assessed. Furthermore, it should be ensured that all capital and liabilities which are counted towards the consolidated minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities are located in entities where losses are likely to occur, or are otherwise available to absorb losses. This Regulation should allow for a multiple point of entry or a single point of entry resolution. The minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities should reflect the resolution strategy which is appropriate to a group in accordance with the resolution plan. In particular, the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities should be required at the appropriate level in the group in order to reflect a multiple point of entry or a single point of entry approach contained in the resolution plan while keeping in mind that there could be circumstances where an approach different from that contained in the plan is used as it would allow, for instance, reaching the resolution objectives more efficiently. Against that background, regardless of whether a group has chosen the multiple point of entry or the single point of entry approach, all entities of the group should have at any time a robust minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities so as to avoid the risk of contagion or of a bank run. 85 The best method of resolution should be chosen depending on the circumstances of the case and, for that purpose, all of the resolution tools provided for in Directive 2014 59 EU should be available. When deciding on the resolution scheme, the Board, the Council and the Commission should, to the extent possible, respectively opt for the scheme that is the least costly for the Fund. 86 Directive 2014 59 EU confers power on the national resolution authorities to write down and convert capital instruments, since the conditions for the write down and conversion of capital instruments may coincide with the conditions for resolution and in such a case, an assessment is to be made of whether the sole write down and conversion of the capital instruments is sufficient to restore the financial soundness of the entity concerned or whether it is also necessary to take resolution action. As a rule, it will be used in the context of resolution. The Board, under the control of the Commission or, where relevant, of the Council, should replace the national reso lution authorities also in that function and should therefore be empowered to assess whether the conditions for the write down and conversion of capital instruments are met and to decide whether to place an entity under resolution, if the requirements for resolution are also fulfilled. 87 The efficiency and uniformity of resolution action should be ensured in all of the participating Member States. For that purpose, where a national resolution authority has not applied or has not complied with a decision by the Board pursuant to this Regulation or has applied it in a way which poses a threat to any of the resolution ob jectives or to the efficient implementation of the resolution scheme, the Board should be empowered to transfer to another person specified rights, assets or liabilities of an institution under resolution, to require the conversion of debt instruments which contain a contractual term for conversion in certain circumstances or to adopt any necessary action which significantly addresses the threat to the relevant resolution objective. Any action by a national resolution authority that would restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the Board should be excluded. 88 The relevant entities, bodies and authorities involved in the application of this Regulation should cooperate with each other in accordance with the duty of sincere cooperation enshrined in the Treaties. 89 In order to enhance the effectiveness of the SRM, the Board should closely cooperate with EBA in all circum stances. Where appropriate the Board should also cooperate with the ESRB, the European Supervisory 30.7.2014 L 225 16 Official Journal of the European Union EN  Authority European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority EIOPA established by Regulation EU No 1094 2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 , the European Supervisory Authority European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA , established by Regulation EU No 1095 2010 of the European Parlia ment and of the Council 2 , and the other authorities which constitute the ESFS. Moreover, the Board should closely cooperate with the ECB and the other authorities empowered to supervise entities within the SSM, in par ticular for groups subject to the consolidated supervision by the ECB. To effectively manage the resolution process of failing banks, the Board should cooperate with the national resolution authorities at all stages of the resolution process. Thus, that cooperation is necessary not only for the implementation of resolution decisions taken by the Board, but also prior to the adoption of any resolution decision, at the stage of resolution planning or during the phase of early intervention. The Board should be able to cooperate with relevant resolution author ities and facilities financing direct or indirect public financial assistance. 90 When applying resolution tools and exercising resolution powers, the Board should instruct the national reso lution authorities to ensure that the representatives of the employees of the entities concerned are informed and, where appropriate, are consulted, as provided for in Directive 2014 59 EU. 91 Since the Board replaces the national resolution authorities of the participating Member States in their resolution decisions, the Board should also replace those authorities for the purposes of the cooperation with non partici pating Member States, including in the resolution colleges as referred to in Directive 2014 59 EU as far as the resolution functions are concerned. 92 As many institutions operate not only within the Union, but internationally, an effective resolution mechanism needs to set out principles of cooperation with the relevant third country authorities. Support to third country authorities should be provided in accordance with the legal framework provided for in Article 88 of Directive 2014 59 EU. In order to ensure a coherent approach vis à vis third countries, the taking of divergent decisions in the participating Member States with respect to the recognition of resolution proceedings conducted in third countries in relation to institutions or parent undertakings which have subsidiaries or other assets, rights or liabil ities located in the participating Member States should be avoided as far as possible. The Board should therefore be enabled to issue recommendations in that regard. 93 In order to perform its tasks effectively, the Board should have appropriate investigatory powers. It should be able to require all necessary information either through the national resolution authorities, or directly, after informing them, and to conduct investigations and on site inspections, where appropriate in cooperation with national competent authorities, making full use of all information available to the ECB and the national compe tent authorities. In the context of resolution, on site inspections should be available for the Board to ensure that decisions are taken on the basis of fully accurate information and to monitor implementation by national author ities effectively. 94 In order to ensure that the Board has access to all relevant information, the relevant entities and their employees or third parties to whom the entities concerned have outsourced functions or activities should not be able to invoke the requirements of professional secrecy to prevent the disclosure of information to the Board. At the same time, the disclosure of such information to the Board should not be deemed to infringe the requirements of professional secrecy. 95 In order to ensure compliance with decisions adopted within the framework of the SRM, proportionate and dissuasive fines should be imposed in the event of an infringement. The Board should be entitled to impose fines or periodic penalty payments on undertakings for failure to comply with its decisions addressed to them. 30.7.2014 L 225 17 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 Regulation EU No 1094 2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervi sory Authority European Investment and Occupational Pensions Authority , amending Decision No 716 2009 EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009 79 EC OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 48 . 2 Regulation EU No 1095 2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervi sory Authority European Securities and Markets Authority , amending Decision No 716 2009 EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009 77 EC OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84 .   96 Where a national resolution authority infringes the rules of the SRM by not using the powers conferred on it under national law to implement an instruction by the Board, the Member State concerned may be liable to make good any damage caused to individuals, including, where applicable, to the institution or group under resolution, or any creditor of any part of that entity or group in any Member State, in accordance with the relevant case law. 97 In order to guarantee its full autonomy and independence, the Board should have an autonomous budget with revenues from obligatory contributions from the institutions in the participating Member States. Appropriate rules should be laid down governing the budget of the Board, the preparation of the budget, the adoption of internal rules specifying the procedure for the establishment and implementation of the budget, and the internal and external audit of the accounts. 98 This Regulation should be without prejudice to the ability of Member States to levy fees to cover the administra tive expenses of their national resolution authorities. 99 Participating Member States have jointly agreed to ensure that non participating Member States are to be reim bursed promptly and with interest for the amount that a non participating Member State has paid in own resources in respect of any application of the Union budget for the purposes of meeting non contractual liabilities and costs relating thereto in relation to the performance of tasks under this Regulation. Participating Member States have concluded an agreement to implement that commitment. 100 There are circumstances in which the effectiveness of the resolution tools applied may depend on the availability of short term funding for the entity or a bridge entity, the provision of guarantees to potential purchasers, or the provision of capital to the bridge entity. Notwithstanding the role of central banks in providing liquidity to the financial system even in times of stress, it is therefore important to set up a fund to avoid that the funds needed for such purposes come from the national budgets. It should be the financial industry, as a whole, that finances the stabilisation of the financial system. 101 It is necessary to ensure that the Fund is fully available for the purpose of the resolution of failing institutions. Therefore, the Fund should not be used for any other purpose than the efficient implementation of resolution tools and resolution powers. Furthermore, it should be used only in accordance with the applicable resolution ob jectives and principles. Accordingly, the Board should ensure that any losses, costs or other expenses incurred in connection with the use of the resolution tools are first borne by the shareholders and the creditors of the institu tion under resolution. Only where the resources from shareholders and creditors are exhausted should the losses, costs or other expenses incurred with the resolution tools be borne by the Fund. 102 As a principle, contributions should be collected from the industry prior to, and independently of, any operation of resolution. When prior funding is insufficient to cover the losses or costs incurred by the use of the Fund, ad ditional contributions should be collected to bear the additional cost or loss. Moreover, the Fund should be able to contract borrowings or other forms of support from institutions, financial institutions or other third parties in the event that the ex ante and ex post contributions are not immediately accessible or do not cover the expenses incurred by the use of the Fund in relation to resolution actions. 103 In order to avoid double payments, Member States should be able to make use of available financial means resulting from national bank levies, taxes or resolution contributions established between 17 June 2010 and 2 July 2014 for the purpose of the ex ante contributions. 104 In order to reach a critical mass and to avoid pro cyclical effects which would arise if the Fund had to rely solely on ex post contributions in a systemic crisis, it is indispensable that the ex ante available financial means of the Fund amount at least to a certain minimum target level. 30.7.2014 L 225 18 Official Journal of the European Union EN   105 The target level of the Fund should be established as a percentage of the amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions authorised in the participating Member States. However, since the amount of the total liabilities of those institutions would be, taking into account the functions of the Fund, a more adequate benchmark, the Commission should assess whether covered deposits or total liabilities is a more appropriate basis and if a minimum absolute amount for the Fund should be introduced in the future, maintaining a level playing field with Directive 2014 59 EU. 106 An appropriate time frame should be set to reach the target level for the Fund. However, it should be possible for the Board to adjust the contribution period to take into account significant disbursements made from the Fund. 107 Ensuring effective and sufficient financing of the Fund is of paramount importance to the credibility of the SRM. The capacity of the Board to contract alternative funding means for the Fund should be enhanced in a manner that optimises the cost of funding and preserves the creditworthiness of the Fund. Immediately after the entry into force of this Regulation, the necessary steps should be taken by the Board in cooperation with the partici pating Member States to develop the appropriate methods and modalities permitting the enhancement of the borrowing capacity of the Fund that should be in place by the date of application of this Regulation. 108 Where participating Member States have already established national resolution financing arrangements, they should be able to provide that the national resolution financing arrangements use their available financial means, collected from entities in the past by way of ex ante contributions, to compensate entities for the ex ante contribu tions which those entities should pay into the Fund. Such restitution should be without prejudice to the obliga tions of Member States under Directive 2014 49 EU. 109 In order to ensure a fair calculation of contributions and provide incentives to operate under a model which presents less risk, contributions to the Fund should take account of the degree of risk incurred by the credit insti tution in accordance with Directive 2014 59 EU and with the delegated acts adopted pursuant thereto. 110 In order to ensure the proper sharing of resolution costs between deposit guarantee schemes and the Fund, the deposit guarantee scheme to which an institution under resolution is affiliated should be required to make a contribution not greater than the amount of losses that it would have had to bear if the entity had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. 111 So as to protect the value of the amounts held in the Fund, those amounts should be invested in sufficiently safe, diversified and liquid assets. 112 Where close cooperation of a participating Member State whose currency is not the euro with the ECB is termin ated in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation EU No 1024 2013, a fair partition of the cumulated contribu tions of the participating Member State concerned should be decided taking into account the interests of the participating Member State concerned and the Fund. 113 The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU in order to determine the rules for the calculation of the interest rate to be applied in the event of a decision on the recovery of misused amounts from the Fund and to guarantee the rights to good administration and of access to docu ments of beneficiaries in procedures in respect of such a recovery determine the type of contributions to the Fund and the matters for which contributions are due, and the manner in which the amount of the contributions is calculated and the way in which they are to be paid specify registration, accounting, reporting and other rules necessary to ensure that the contributions are paid fully and in a timely manner determine the annual contribu tions necessary to cover the administrative expenditure of the Board before it becomes fully operational deter mine the contribution system for institutions that have been authorised to operate after the Fund has reached its target level determine the criteria for the spreading out in time of the contributions determine the criteria for determining the number of years by which the initial period for reaching the target level can be extended deter mine the criteria for establishing the annual contributions when the available financial means of the Fund diminishes below its target level after the initial period determine the measures to specify the circumstances and conditions under which ex post contributions may be temporarily deferred for individual institutions and deter mine the detailed rules for the administration of the Fund and general principles and criteria for its investment strategy. 30.7.2014 L 225 19 Official Journal of the European Union EN   114 The Council should, within the framework of the delegated acts adopted under Directive 2014 59 EU, adopt implementing acts to specify the application of the methodology for the calculation of individual contributions to the Fund, as well as the technical modalities for computing the flat contribution and the risk adjusted contribu tion. That methodology should ensure that both the flat and the risk adjusted elements in the formula for the calculation of individual contributions are accounted in a way that is consistent with resolution principles and in line with the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 103 7 of Directive 2014 59 EU. The methodology should take into account the principle of proportionality, without creating distortions between banking sector structures of the Member States. 115 As reflected in the Declaration No 39 on Article 290 of the TFEU, the Commission, in accordance with the estab lished practice, in preparation of draft delegated acts provided for in this Regulation, should continue to consult experts appointed by the Member States. It is also of particular importance in this area that the Commission, where relevant, carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work with the ECB and the Board in their fields of competence. 116 Resolution actions should be properly notified and, subject to the limited exceptions laid down in this Regulation, made public. However, as information obtained by the Board, the national resolution authorities and their profes sional advisers during the resolution process is likely to be sensitive, before the resolution decision is made public, that information should be subject to the requirements of professional secrecy. The fact that information on the contents and details of resolution plans and the result of any assessment of those plans may have far reaching effects, in particular on the undertakings concerned, must be taken into account. Any information provided in respect of a decision before it is taken, be it on whether the conditions for resolution are satisfied, on the use of a specific tool or of any action during the proceedings, must be presumed to have effects on the public and private interests concerned by the action. However, information that the Board and the national resolution authorities are examining a specific entity could be enough to have negative effects on that entity. It is therefore necessary to ensure that there are appropriate mechanisms for maintaining the confidentiality of such informa tion, such as the content and details of resolution plans and the result of any assessment carried out in that context. 117 To preserve the confidentiality of the work of the Board, its members and its staff, including the staff exchanged with or seconded by participating Member States for the purpose of carrying out resolution duties, should be subject to requirements of professional secrecy, even after their duties have ceased. Those requirements should also apply to other persons authorised by the Board, to persons authorised or appointed by the national reso lution authorities of the Member States to conduct on site inspections, and to observers invited to attend the plenary and executive sessions meetings of the Board and to observers from non participating Member States that take part in internal resolution teams. For the purpose of performing the tasks conferred on it by this Regu lation, the Board should be authorised, subject to conditions, to exchange information with national or Union authorities and bodies. 118 In order to ensure that the Board is assimilated in the ESFS, Regulation EU No 1093 2010 should be amended in order to include the Board in the concept of competent authorities established by that Regulation. Such assimi lation of the Board and competent authorities pursuant to Regulation EU No 1093 2010 is consistent with the functions attributed to EBA pursuant to Article 25 of Regulation EU No 1093 2010 to contribute to and parti cipate actively in the development and coordination of recovery and resolution plans and to aim to facilitate the resolution of failing entities and in particular cross border groups. 119 Until the Board is fully operational, the Commission should be responsible for the initial operations including the designation of an interim Chair to authorise all necessary payments on behalf of the Board. 120 The SRM brings together the Board, the Council, the Commission and the resolution authorities of the partici pating Member States. The Court of Justice has jurisdiction to review the legality of decisions adopted by the Board, the Council and the Commission, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU, as well as for determining their non contractual liability. Furthermore, the Court of Justice has, in accordance with Article 267 TFEU, competence to give preliminary rulings upon request of national judicial authorities on the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies or agencies of the Union. National judicial authorities should be competent, in accord ance with their national law, to review the legality of decisions adopted by the resolution authorities of the parti cipating Member States in the exercise of the powers conferred on them by this Regulation, as well as to deter mine their non contractual liability. 30.7.2014 L 225 20 Official Journal of the European Union EN   121 This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the rights, freedoms and principles recognised in particular by the Charter, and, in particular, the right to property, the protection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial and the right of defence, and should be implemented in accordance with those rights and principles. 122 Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely setting up an efficient and effective single European framework for the resolution of entities and ensuring the consistent application of resolution rules, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather be better achieved at the Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union TEU . In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. 123 The Commission should review the application of this Regulation in order to assess its impact on the internal market and to determine whether any modifications or further developments are needed in order to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the SRM, in particular whether the banking Union needs to be completed with the harmonisation at Union level of insolvency proceedings for failed institutions. 124 The transfer of contributions raised at national level under this Regulation should allow the Fund to operate and thus the resolution tools to be applied in an effective manner. Therefore, the provisions of this Regulation relating to resolution tools and the contributions should apply from 1 January 2016. From December 2015, it should be possible to postpone that date by periods of one month where the conditions allowing the transfer of the contri butions raised at national level have not been met, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION PART I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Subject matter This Regulation establishes uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of the entities referred to in Article 2 that are established in the participating Member States referred to in Article 4.

The national resolution authorities shall prepare resolution plans, after consulting the relevant national competent authorities and the national resolution authorities of the participating and non participating Member States, in which significant branches are located, insofar as relevant to the significant branch. Article 10 Assessment of resolvability 1. When drafting and updating resolution plans in accordance with Article 8, the Board, after consulting the compe tent authorities, including the ECB, and the resolution authorities of non participating Member States in which signifi cant branches are located insofar as relevant to the significant branch, shall conduct an assessment of the extent to which institutions and groups are resolvable without the assumption of any of the following a any extraordinary public financial support besides the use of the Fund established in accordance with Article 67 b any central bank emergency liquidity assistance or c any central bank liquidity assistance provided under non standard collateralisation, tenor and interest rate terms. 2. The ECB or the relevant national competent authority shall provide the Board with a recovery plan or group recovery plan. The Board shall examine the recovery plan with a view to identifying any actions in the recovery plan which may adversely impact the resolvability of the institution or group and make recommendations to the ECB or the national competent authority on those matters. 3. When drafting a resolution plan, the Board shall assess the extent to which such an entity is resolvable in accord ance with this Regulation. An entity shall be deemed to be resolvable if it is feasible and credible for the Board to either liquidate it under normal insolvency proceedings or to resolve it by applying to it resolution tools and exercising reso lution powers while avoiding, to the maximum extent possible, any significant adverse consequences for financial systems, including circumstances of broader financial instability or system wide events, of the Member State in which the entity is situated, or other Member States, or the Union and with a view to ensuring the continuity of critical func tions carried out by the entity. The Board shall notify EBA in a timely manner where an institution is deemed not to be resolvable. 4. A group shall be deemed to be resolvable if it is feasible and credible for the Board to either liquidate group entities under normal insolvency proceedings or to resolve them by applying resolution tools and exercising resolution powers in relation to group entities while avoiding, to the maximum extent possible, any significant adverse consequences for financial systems, including circumstances of broader financial instability or system wide events, of the Member States in which group entities are established, or other Member States or the Union and with a view to ensuring the continuity of critical functions carried out by those group entities, where they can be easily separated in a timely manner or by other means. The Board shall notify EBA in a timely manner where a group is deemed not to be resolvable. 30.7.2014 L 225 31 Official Journal of the European Union EN  5. For the purposes of paragraphs 3, 4 and 10, significant adverse consequences for the financial system or threat to financial stability refers to a situation where the financial system is actually or potentially exposed to a disruption that may give rise to financial distress liable to jeopardise the orderly functioning, efficiency and integrity of the internal market or the economy or the financial system of one or more Member States. In determining the significant adverse consequences the Board shall take into account the relevant warnings and recommendations of the ESRB and the rele vant criteria developed by EBA in considering the identification and measurement of systemic risk. 6. For the purpose of the assessment referred to in this Article, the Board shall examine the matters specified in Section C of the Annex to Directive 2014 59 EU. 7. If, pursuant to an assessment of resolvability for an entity or a group carried out in accordance with paragraph 3 or 4, the Board, after consulting the competent authorities, including the ECB, determines that there are substantive impediments to the resolvability of that entity or group, the Board shall prepare a report, in cooperation with the competent authorities, addressed to the institution or the parent undertaking analysing the substantive impediments to the effective application of resolution tools and the exercise of resolution powers. That report shall consider the impact on the institution s business model and recommend any proportionate and targeted measures that, in the Board s view, are necessary or appropriate to remove those impediments in accordance with paragraph 10. 8. The report shall also be notified to the competent authorities and to the resolution authorities of non participating Member States in which significant branches of institutions which are not part of a group are located. It shall be supported by reasons for the assessment or determination in question and shall indicate how that assessment or determination complies with the requirement for proportionate application laid down in Article 6. 9. Within four months from the date of receipt of the report, the entity or the parent undertaking shall propose to the Board possible measures to address or remove the substantive impediments identified in the report. The Board shall communicate any measure proposed by the entity or parent undertaking to the competent authorities, to EBA and, where significant branches of institutions that are not part of a group are located in non participating Member States, to the resolution authorities of those Member States. 10. The Board, after consulting the competent authorities, shall assess whether the measures referred to in para graph 9 effectively address or remove the substantive impediments in question. If the measures proposed by the entity or parent undertaking concerned do not effectively reduce or remove the impediments to resolvability, the Board shall take a decision, after consulting the competent authorities and, where appropriate, the designated macro prudential authority, indicating that the measures proposed do not effectively reduce or remove the impediments to resolvability, and instructing the national resolution authorities to require the institution, the parent undertaking, or any subsidiary of the group concerned, to take any of the measures listed in paragraph 11. In identifying alternative measures, the Board shall demonstrate how the measures proposed by the institution would not be able to remove the impediments to resolvability and how the alternative measures proposed are proportionate in removing them. The Board shall take into account the threat to financial stability of those impediments to resolvability and the effect of the measures on the business of the institution, its stability and its ability to contribute to the economy, on the internal market for financial services and on the financial stability in other Member States and the Union as a whole. The Board shall also take into account the need to avoid any impact on the institution or the group concerned which would go beyond what is necessary to remove the impediment to resolvability or would be disproportionate. 11. For the purpose of paragraph 10, the Board, where applicable, shall instruct the national resolution authorities to take any of the following measures a to require the entity to revise any intragroup financing agreements or review the absence thereof, or draw up service agreements whether intra group or with third parties to cover the provision of critical functions b to require the entity to limit its maximum individual and aggregate exposures 30.7.2014 L 225 32 Official Journal of the European Union EN   c to impose specific or regular additional information requirements relevant for resolution purposes d to require the entity to divest specific assets e to require the entity to limit or cease specific existing or proposed activities f to restrict or prevent the development of new or existing business lines or sale of new or existing products g to require changes to legal or operational structures of the entity or any group entity, either directly or indirectly under their control, so as to reduce complexity in order to ensure that critical functions may be legally and opera tionally separated from other functions through the application of the resolution tools h to require an entity to set up a parent financial holding company in a Member State or a Union parent financial holding company i to require an entity to issue eligible liabilities to meet the requirements of Article 12 j to require an entity to take other steps to meet the requirements referred to in Article 12, including in particular to attempt to renegotiate any eligible liability, Additional Tier 1 instrument or Tier 2 instrument it has issued, with a view to ensuring that any decision of the Board to write down or convert that liability or instrument would be effected under the law of the jurisdiction governing that liability or instrument. Where applicable, the national resolution authorities shall directly take the measures referred to in points a to j of the first subparagraph. 12. The national resolution authorities shall implement the instructions of the Board in accordance with Article 29. 13. A decision made pursuant to paragraphs 10 and 11 shall meet the following requirements a it shall be supported by reasons for the assessment or determination in question b it shall indicate how that assessment or determination complies with the requirement for proportionate application laid down in paragraph 10. Article 11 Simplified obligations for certain institutions 1. The Board, on its own initiative after consulting a national resolution authority or upon proposal by a national resolution authority, may apply simplified obligations in relation to the drafting of resolution plans referred to in Article 8 or may waive the obligation of drafting those plans in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 9 of this Article. 2. National resolution authorities may propose to the Board to apply simplified obligations to institutions or groups pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4 or to waive the obligation of drafting resolution plans pursuant to paragraph 7. That proposal shall be reasoned and shall be supported by all of the relevant documentation. 3. On receiving a proposal to apply simplified obligations pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, or when acting on its own initiative, the Board shall conduct an assessment of the institution or group concerned and shall apply simplified obligations, if the failure of the institution or group is not likely to have significant adverse consequences for the finan cial system or be a threat to financial stability within the meaning of Article 10 5 . For those purposes, the Board shall take into account a the nature of the institution s or group s business, its shareholding structure, its legal form, its risk profile, size and legal status, its interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general, the scope and complexity of its activities b its membership of an IPS or other cooperative mutual solidarity systems as referred to in Article 113 7 of Regu lation EU No 575 2013 30.7.2014 L 225 33 Official Journal of the European Union EN   c any exercise of investment services or activities as defined in Article 4 1 2 of Directive 2014 65 EU of the Euro pean Parliament and of the Council 1 and d whether its failure and subsequent winding up under normal insolvency proceedings would be likely to have a signif icant negative effect on financial markets, on other institutions, on funding conditions, or on the wider economy. The Board shall make the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph after consulting, where appropriate, the national macroprudential authority and, where appropriate, the ESRB. 4. When applying simplified obligations, the Board shall determine a the contents and details of resolution plans provided for in Article 8 b the date by which the first resolution plans are to be drawn up and the frequency for updating resolution plans which may be lower than that provided for in Article 8 12 c the contents and details of the information required from institutions as provided for in Article 8 9 of this Regu lation and in Section B of the Annex to Directive 2014 59 EU d the level of detail for the assessment of resolvability provided for in Article 10 of this Regulation, and in Section C of the Annex to Directive 2014 59 EU. 5. The application of simplified obligations shall not in itself affect the Board s power to take any resolution action. 6. Where simplified obligations are applied, the Board shall impose full, unsimplified obligations at any time if any of the circumstances that justified them no longer exist. 7. Without prejudice to Articles 9 and 31, on receiving a proposal to waive the obligation of drafting resolution plans pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, or when acting on its own initiative, the Board shall, pursuant to para graph 3 of this Article, waive the application of the obligation of drafting resolution plans to institutions affiliated to a central body and wholly or partially exempt from prudential requirements in national law in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation EU No 575 2013. Where a waiver is granted in accordance with the first subparagraph, the obligation of drafting the resolution plan shall apply on a consolidated basis to the central body and institutions affiliated to it within the meaning of Article 10 of Regulation EU No 575 2013. For that purpose, any reference in this Chapter to a group shall include a central body and institutions affiliated to it within the meaning of Article 10 of Regulation EU No 575 2013 and their subsidiaries, and any reference to parent undertakings or institutions that are subject to consolidated supervision pursuant to Article 111 of Directive 2013 36 EU shall include the central body. 8. Institutions that are subject to direct supervision by the ECB pursuant to Article 6 4 of Regulation EU No 1024 2013 or that constitute a significant share in the financial system of a participating Member State shall be the subject of individual resolution plans. For the purposes of this paragraph, the operations of an institution shall be considered to constitute a significant share of that participating Member State s financial system where a the total value of its assets exceeds EUR 30 000 000 000 or b the ratio of its total assets over the GDP of the Member State of establishment exceeds 20 , unless the total value of its assets is below EUR 5 000 000 000. 9. Where the national resolution authority which has proposed the application of simplified obligations or the grant of a waiver in accordance with paragraph 2 considers that the decision to apply simplified obligations or to grant the waiver must be withdrawn, it shall submit a proposal to the Board to that end. In that case, the Board shall take a deci sion on the proposed withdrawal taking full account of the justification for withdrawal put forward by the national reso lution authority in the light of the factors or circumstances referred to in paragraph 3 or in paragraphs 7 and 8. 10. The Board shall inform EBA of its application of this Article. 30.7.2014 L 225 34 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 Directive 2014 65 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002 92 EC and Directive 2011 61 EU OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 349 .  Article 12 Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities 1. The Board shall, after consulting competent authorities, including the ECB, determine the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities as referred to in paragraph 4, subject to write down and conversion powers, which the entities and groups referred to in Article 7 2 , and the entities and groups referred to in Article 7 4 b and 5 where the conditions for the application of these paragraphs are met, are required to meet at all times. 2. When drafting resolution plans in accordance with Article 9, national resolution authorities shall, after consulting competent authorities, determine the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, as referred to in para graph 4, subject to write down and conversion powers, which the entities referred to in Article 7 3 are required to meet at all times. In that regard the procedure established in Article 31 shall apply. 3. In order to ensure effective and consistent application of this Article, the Board shall issue guidelines and address instructions to national resolution authorities relating to specific entities or groups. 4. The minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities shall be calculated as the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities expressed as a percentage of the total liabilities and own funds of the institution. For the purpose of the first subparagraph derivative liabilities shall be included in the total liabilities on the basis that full recognition is given to counterparty netting rights. 5. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Board shall exempt mortgage credit institutions financed by covered bonds which, according to national law, are not allowed to receive deposits, from the obligation to meet, at all times, a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, as a those institutions will be wound up through national insolvency procedures, or other type of procedures imple mented in accordance with Article 38, 40 or 42 of Directive 2014 59 EU, provided for those institutions and b such national insolvency procedures, or other type of procedures, will ensure that creditors of those institutions, including holders of covered bonds where relevant, will bear losses in a way that meets the resolution objectives. 6. The minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities referred to in paragraph 4 shall not exceed the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities sufficient to ensure that, if the bail in tool were to be applied, the losses of an institution or a parent undertaking as referred to in Article 2, as well as of the ultimate parent undertaking of that institution or parent undertaking and any institution or financial institution included in the consolidated accounts of that ultimate parent undertaking, could be absorbed, and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of those entities could be restored to a level necessary to enable them to continue to comply with the conditions for authorisation and to continue to carry out the activities for which they are authorised under Directive 2013 36 EU or equivalent legislation and to sustain sufficient market confidence in the institution or parent undertaking referred to in Article 2 and the ultimate parent undertaking of that institution or parent undertaking and any institution or financial institution included in the consolidated accounts of that ultimate parent undertaking. Where the resolution plan anticipates that certain classes of eligible liabilities might be excluded from bail in under Article 27 5 , or that certain classes of eligible liabilities might be transferred to a recipient in full under a partial transfer, the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities referred to in paragraph 4 shall not exceed the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities necessary to ensure that the institution or parent undertaking referred to in Article 2 has sufficient other eligible liabilities to ensure that losses of the institution or the parent undertaking referred to in Article 2 as well as of the ultimate parent undertaking of that institution or parent undertaking and any institution or financial institution included in the consolidated accounts of that ultimate parent undertaking could be absorbed and 30.7.2014 L 225 35 Official Journal of the European Union EN  the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of those entities could be restored to a level necessary to enable them to continue to comply with the conditions for authorisation and to carry out the activities for which they are authorised under Direct ive 2013 36 EU or equivalent legislation and to sustain sufficient market confidence in the institution or parent under taking and the ultimate parent undertaking of that institution or parent undertaking and any institution or financial institution included in the consolidated accounts of that ultimate parent undertaking. The minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities referred to in paragraph 4 shall not be inferior to the total amount of any own funds requirements and buffer requirements under Regulation EU No 575 2013 and Directive 2013 36 EU. 7. Within the limits laid down in paragraph 6 of this Article, in order to ensure that an entity referred to in Article 2 can be resolved by the application of the resolution tools including, where appropriate, the bail in tool, in a way that meets the resolution objectives, the determination referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be made on the basis of the following criteria a the size, the business model, the funding model and the risk profile of the institution and parent undertaking referred to in Article 2 b the extent to which the deposit guarantee scheme could contribute to the financing of resolution in accordance with Article 79 c the extent to which the failure of the institution and parent undertaking referred to in Article 2 would have signifi cant adverse consequences for the financial system or would be a threat to financial stability within the meaning of Article 10 5 , including, due to its interconnectedness with other institutions or with the rest of the financial system through contagion to other institutions. 8. The determination shall specify the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities that the institutions are to comply with on an individual basis, and that parent undertakings are to comply with on a consolidated basis. The minimum aggregate amount requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities at consolidated level of a Union parent undertaking established in a participating Member State shall be determined by the Board, after consulting the consoli dating supervisor, on the basis of the criteria laid down in paragraph 7, and of whether the third country subsidiaries of the group are to be resolved separately in accordance with the resolution plan. 9.

For the purpose of point d of the first subparagraph, where a liability confers upon its owner a right to early reimbur sement, the maturity of that liability shall be the first date where such right arises. 17. Where a liability is governed by the law of a jurisdiction outside the Union, the Board may instruct national reso lution authorities to require the institution to demonstrate that any decision of the Board to write down or convert that liability would be effected under the law of that jurisdiction, having regard to the terms of the contract governing the li ability, international agreements on the recognition of resolution proceedings and other relevant matters. If the Board is not satisfied that any decision would be effected under the law of that jurisdiction, the liability shall not be counted towards the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. 18. If the Commission submits a legislative proposal pursuant to Article 45 18 of Directive 2014 59 EU, it shall, if appropriate, submit a legislative proposal amending this Regulation in the same way. 30.7.2014 L 225 37 Official Journal of the European Union EN  CHAPTER 2 Early intervention Article 13 Early intervention 1.

The ECB or the relevant national competent authority shall provide the Board with all of the information necessary in order to update the resolution plan and prepare for the possible resolution of the institution and for valuation of the assets and liabilities of the institution in accordance with Article 20 1 to 15 . 3. The Board shall have the power to require the institution, or the parent undertaking, to contact potential purcha sers in order to prepare for the resolution of the institution, subject to the criteria specified in Article 39 2 of Directive 2014 59 EU and the requirements of professional secrecy laid down in Article 88 of this Regulation. The Board shall also have the power to require the relevant national resolution authority to draft a preliminary reso lution scheme for the institution or group concerned. The Board shall inform the ECB, the relevant national competent authorities and the relevant national resolution author ities of any action it takes pursuant to this paragraph. 4.

The ECB or the national competent authority, the Board and the relevant national resolution authorities shall ensure that the additional measure referred to in paragraph 4 and any action of the Board aimed at preparing for reso lution under paragraph 2 are consistent. CHAPTER 3 Resolution Article 14 Resolution objectives 1. When acting under the resolution procedure referred to in Article 18, the Board, the Council, the Commission, and, where relevant, the national resolution authorities, in respect of their respective responsibilities, shall take into account the resolution objectives, and choose the resolution tools and resolution powers which, in their view, best achieve the resolution objectives that are relevant in the circumstances of the case. 30.7.2014 L 225 38 Official Journal of the European Union EN  2. The resolution objectives referred to in paragraph 1 are the following a to ensure the continuity of critical functions b to avoid significant adverse effects on financial stability, in particular by preventing contagion, including to market infrastructures, and by maintaining market discipline c to protect public funds by minimising reliance on extraordinary public financial support d to protect depositors covered by Directive 2014 49 EU and investors covered by Directive 97 9 EC e to protect client funds and client assets. When pursuing the objectives referred to in the first subparagraph, the Board, the Council, the Commission and, where relevant, the national resolution authorities, shall seek to minimise the cost of resolution and avoid destruction of value unless necessary to achieve the resolution objectives. 3. Subject to different provisions of this Regulation, the resolution objectives are of equal significance, and shall be balanced, as appropriate, to the nature and circumstances of each case. Article 15 General principles governing resolution 1. When acting under the resolution procedure referred to in Article 18, the Board, the Council, the Commission and, where relevant, the national resolution authorities, shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the resolution action is taken in accordance with the following principles a the shareholders of the institution under resolution bear first losses b creditors of the institution under resolution bear losses after the shareholders in accordance with the order of priority of their claims pursuant to Article 17, save as expressly provided otherwise in this Regulation c the management body and senior management of the institution under resolution are replaced, except in those cases where the retention of the management body and senior management, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the circumstances, is considered to be necessary for the achievement of the resolution objectives d the management body and senior management of the institution under resolution shall provide all necessary assist ance for the achievement of the resolution objectives e natural and legal persons are made liable, subject to national law, under civil or criminal law, for their responsibility for the failure of the institution under resolution f except where otherwise provided in this Regulation, creditors of the same class are treated in an equitable manner g no creditor shall incur greater losses than would have been incurred if an entity referred to in Article 2 had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings in accordance with the safeguards provided for in Article 29 h covered deposits are fully protected and i resolution action is taken in accordance with the safeguards in this Regulation. 2. Where an institution is a group entity, without prejudice to Article 14, the Board, the Council and the Commis sion, when deciding on the application of resolution tools and the exercise of resolution powers, shall act in a way that minimises the impact on other group entities and on the group as a whole and minimises the adverse effect on financial stability in the Union and its Member States, in particular in the countries where the group operates. 30.7.2014 L 225 39 Official Journal of the European Union EN  3. Where the sale of business tool, the bridge institution tool or the asset separation tool is applied to an entity referred to in Article 2 of this Regulation, that entity shall be considered to be the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or analogous insolvency proceedings for the purposes of Article 5 1 of Council Directive 2001 23 EC 1 . 4. When deciding on the application of resolution tools and the exercise of resolution powers, the Board shall instruct national resolution authorities to inform and consult employee representatives where appropriate.

Article 16 Resolution of financial institutions and parent undertakings 1. The Board shall decide on a resolution action in relation to a financial institution established in a participating Member State, where the conditions laid down in Article 18 1 are met with regard to both the financial institution and with regard to the parent undertaking subject to consolidating supervision. 2. The Board shall take a resolution action in relation to a parent undertaking referred to in point b of Article 2, where the conditions laid down in Article 18 1 are met with regard to both that parent undertaking and with regard to one or more subsidiaries which are institutions or, where the subsidiary is not established in the Union, the third country authority has determined that it meets the conditions for resolution under the law of that third country. 3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2 and notwithstanding the fact that a parent undertaking does not meet the conditions established in Article 18 1 , the Board may decide on resolution action with regard to that parent undertaking when one or more of its subsidiaries which are institutions meet the conditions established in Article 18 1 , 4 and 5 and their assets and liabilities are such that their failure threatens an institution or the group as a whole and resolution action with regard to that parent undertaking is necessary for the resolution of such subsidiaries which are institutions or for the resolution of the group as a whole. Where a national resolution authority informs the Board that the in solvency law of the Member State provides that groups be treated as a whole and resolution action with regard to the parent undertaking is necessary for the resolution of such subsidiaries which are institutions or for the resolution of the group as a whole, the Board may also decide on resolution action with regard to the parent undertaking. For the purposes of the first subparagraph, when assessing whether the conditions in Article 18 1 are met in respect of one or more subsidiaries which are institutions, the Board may disregard any intra group capital or loss transfers between the entities, including the exercise of write down or conversion powers. Article 17 Order of priority of claims 1. When applying the bail in tool to an entity referred to in Article 2 of this Regulation, and without prejudice to liabilities excluded from the bail in tool under Article 27 3 of this Regulation, the Board, the Commission, or, where applicable, the national resolution authorities, shall decide on the exercise of the write down and conversion powers, including on any possible application of Article 27 5 of this Regulation, and the national resolution authorities shall exercise those powers in accordance with Articles 47 and 48 of Directive 2014 59 EU and in accordance with the reverse order of priority of claims laid down in their national law, including the provisions transposing Article 108 of that Directive. 30.7.2014 L 225 40 Official Journal of the European Union EN 1 Council Directive 2001 23 EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses OJ L 82, 22.3.2001, p. 16 .  2.

The Board shall adopt a resolution scheme pursuant to paragraph 6 in relation to entities and groups referred to in Article 7 2 , and to the entities and groups referred to in Article 7 4 b and 5 where the conditions for the application of those paragraphs are met, only when it assesses, in its executive session, on receiving a communication pursuant to the fourth subparagraph, or on its own initiative, that the following conditions are met a the entity is failing or is likely to fail b having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector measures, including measures by an IPS, or supervisory action, including early intervention measures or the write down or conversion of relevant capital instruments in accordance with Article 21, taken in respect of the entity, would prevent its failure within a reasonable timeframe c a resolution action is necessary in the public interest pursuant to paragraph 5. An assessment of the condition referred to in point a of the first subparagraph shall be made by the ECB, after consulting the Board. The Board, in its executive session, may make such an assessment only after informing the ECB of its intention and only if the ECB, within three calendar days of receipt of that information, does not make such an assessment. The ECB shall, without delay, provide the Board with any relevant information that the Board requests in order to inform its assessment. Where the ECB assesses that the condition referred to in point a of the first subparagraph is met in relation to an entity or group referred to in the first subparagraph, it shall communicate that assessment without delay to the Commis sion and to the Board. An assessment of the condition referred to in point b of the first subparagraph shall be made by the Board, in its executive session, or, where applicable, by the national resolution authorities, in close cooperation with the ECB. The ECB may also inform the Board or the national resolution authorities concerned that it considers the condition laid down in that point to be met. 2. Without prejudice to cases where the ECB has decided to exercise directly supervisory tasks relating to credit insti tutions pursuant to Article 6 5 b of Regulation EU No 1024 2013, in the event of receipt of a communication pursuant to paragraph 1 or where the Board intends to make an assessment under paragraph 1 on its own initiative in relation to an entity or group referred to in Article 7 3 , the Board shall communicate its assessment to the ECB without delay. 3. The previous adoption of a measure pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation EU No 1024 2013, to Article 27 1 or Article 28 or 29 of Directive 2014 59 EU, or to Article 104 of Directive 2013 36 EU is not a condition for taking a resolution action. 4. For the purposes of point a of paragraph 1, the entity shall be deemed to be failing or to be likely to fail in one or more of the following circumstances a the entity infringes, or there are objective elements to support a determination that the institution will, in the near future, infringe the requirements for continuing authorisation in a way that would justify the withdrawal of the authorisation by the ECB, including but not limited to the fact that the institution has incurred or is likely to incur losses that will deplete all or a significant amount of its own funds b the assets of the entity are, or there are objective elements to support a determination that the assets of the entity will, in the near future, be less than its liabilities 30.7.2014 L 225 41 Official Journal of the European Union EN   c the entity is, or there are objective elements to support a determination that the entity will, in the near future, be unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fall due d extraordinary public financial support is required except where, in order to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State and preserve financial stability, that extraordinary public financial support takes any of the following forms i a State guarantee to back liquidity facilities provided by central banks in accordance with the central banks conditions ii a State guarantee of newly issued liabilities or iii an injection of own funds or purchase of capital instruments at prices and on terms that do not confer an advantage upon the entity, where neither the circumstances referred to in points a , b and c of this paragraph nor the circumstances referred to in Article 21 1 are present at the time the public support is granted. In each of the cases referred to in points i , ii and iii of point d of the first subparagraph, the guarantee or equivalent measures referred to therein shall be confined to solvent entities and shall be conditional on final approval under the Union State aid framework. Those measures shall be of a precautionary and temporary nature and shall be proportionate to remedy the consequences of the serious disturbance and shall not be used to offset losses that the entity has incurred or is likely to incur in the near future. Support measures under point d iii of the first subparagraph shall be limited to injections necessary to address capital shortfall established in the national, Union or SSM wide stress tests, asset quality reviews or equivalent exercises conducted by the ECB, EBA or national authorities, where applicable, confirmed by the competent authority. If the Commission submits a legislative proposal pursuant to Article 32 4 of Directive 2014 59 EU, it shall, if appro priate, submit a legislative proposal amending this Regulation in the same way. 5. For the purposes of point c of paragraph 1 of this Article, a resolution action shall be treated as in the public interest if it is necessary for the achievement of, and is proportionate to one or more of the resolution objectives referred to in Article 14 and winding up of the entity under normal insolvency proceedings would not meet those resolution ob jectives to the same extent. 6. If the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 are met, the Board shall adopt a resolution scheme. The resolution scheme shall a place the entity under resolution b determine the application of the resolution tools to the institution under resolution referred to in Article 22 2 , in particular any exclusions from the application of the bail in in accordance with Article 27 5 and 14 c determine the use of the Fund to support the resolution action in accordance with Article 76 and in accordance with a Commission decision taken in accordance with Article 19. 7. Immediately after the adoption of the resolution scheme, the Board shall transmit it to the Commission. Within 24 hours from the transmission of the resolution scheme by the Board, the Commission shall either endorse the resolution scheme, or object to it with regard to the discretionary aspects of the resolution scheme in the cases not covered in the third subparagraph of this paragraph. Within 12 hours from the transmission of the resolution scheme by the Board, the Commission may propose to the Council a to object to the resolution scheme on the ground that the resolution scheme adopted by the Board does not fulfil the criterion of public interest referred to in paragraph 1 c b to approve or object to a material modification of the amount of the Fund provided for in the resolution scheme of the Board. For the purposes of the third subparagraph, the Council shall act by simple majority. 30.7.2014 L 225 42 Official Journal of the European Union EN  The resolution scheme may enter into force only if no objection has been expressed by the Council or by the Commis sion within a period of 24 hours after its transmission by the Board. The Council or the Commission, as the case may be, shall provide reasons for the exercise of their power of objection. Where, within 24 hours from the transmission of the resolution scheme by the Board, the Council has approved the proposal of the Commission for modification of the resolution scheme on the ground referred to in point b of the third subparagraph or the Commission has objected in accordance with the second subparagraph, the Board shall, within eight hours modify the resolution scheme in accordance with the reasons expressed. Where the resolution scheme adopted by the Board provides for the exclusion of certain liabilities in the exceptional circumstances referred to in Article 27 5 , and where such exclusion requires a contribution by the Fund or an alterna tive financing source, in order to protect the integrity of the internal market, the Commission may prohibit or require amendments to the proposed exclusion setting out adequate reasons based on an infringement of the requirements laid down in Article 27 and in the delegated act adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 44 11 of Directive 2014 59 EU. 8. Where the Council objects to the placing of an institution under resolution on the ground that the public interest criterion referred to in paragraph 1 c is not fulfilled, the relevant entity shall be wound up in an orderly manner in accordance with the applicable national law. 9. The Board shall ensure that the necessary resolution action is taken to carry out the resolution scheme by the rele vant national resolution authorities. The resolution scheme shall be addressed to the relevant national resolution author ities and shall instruct those authorities, which shall take all necessary measures to implement it in accordance with Article 29, by exercising resolution powers. Where State aid or Fund aid is present, the Board shall act in conformity with a decision on that aid taken by the Commission. 10. The Commission shall have the power to obtain from the Board any information which it deems to be relevant for performing its tasks under this Regulation. The Board shall have the power to obtain from any person, in accordance with Chapter 5 of this Title, any information necessary for it to prepare and decide upon a resolution action, including updates and supplements of information provided in the resolution plans. Article 19 State aid and Fund aid 1. Where resolution action involves the granting of State aid pursuant to Article 107 1 TFEU or of Fund aid in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, the adoption of the resolution scheme under Article 18 6 of this Regu lation shall not take place until such time as the Commission has adopted a positive or conditional decision concerning the compatibility of the use of such aid with the internal market. In performing the tasks conferred on them by Article 18 of this Regulation, Union institutions shall act in conformity with the principles established in Article 3 3 of Directive 2014 59 EU and shall make public in an appropriate manner all relevant information on their internal organisation in this regard. 2. On receiving a communication pursuant to Article 18 1 of this Regulation or on its own initiative, if the Board considers that resolution actions could constitute State aid pursuant to Article 107 1 TFEU, it shall invite the partici pating Member State or Member States concerned to immediately notify the envisaged measures to the Commission under Article 108 3 TFEU. The Board shall notify the Commission of any case in which it invites one or more Member States to make a notification under Article 108 3 TFEU. 3. To the extent that the resolution action as proposed by the Board involves the use of the Fund, the Board shall notify the Commission of the proposed use of the Fund. The Board s notification shall include all of the information necessary to enable the Commission to make its assessments pursuant to this paragraph. 30.7.2014 L 225 43 Official Journal of the European Union EN  The notification under this paragraph shall trigger a preliminary investigation by the Commission during the course of which the Commission may request further information from the Board. The Commission shall assess whether the use of the Fund would distort, or threaten to distort, competition by favouring the beneficiary or any other undertaking so as, insofar as it would affect trade between Member States, to be incompatible with the internal market. The Commission shall apply to the use of the Fund the criteria established for the application of State aid rules as enshrined in Article 107 TFEU. The Board shall provide the Commission with the information that the Commission deems to be necessary to carry out that assessment. If the Commission has serious doubts as to the compatibility of the proposed use of the Fund with the internal market, or where the Board has failed to provide the necessary information pursuant to a request of the Commission under the second subparagraph, the Commission shall open an in depth investigation and shall notify the Board accordingly. The Commission shall publish its decision to open an in depth investigation in the Official Journal of the European Union. The Board, any Member State or any person, undertaking or association whose interests may be affected by the use of the Fund, may submit comments to the Commission within such timeframe as may be specified in the notification. The Board may submit observations on the comments submitted by Member States and interested third parties within such timeframe as may be specified by the Commission. At the end of the period of investigation the Commission shall make its assessment as to whether the use of the Fund would be compatible with the internal market. In making its assessments and conducting its investigations pursuant to this paragraph, the Commission shall be guided by all of the relevant regulations adopted under Article 109 TFEU as well as relevant communications, guidance and measures adopted by the Commission in application of the rules of the Treaties relating to State aid as are in force at the time the assessment is to be made. Those measures shall be applied as though references to the Member State respon sible for notifying the aid were references to the Board, and with any other necessary modifications. The Commission shall adopt a decision on the compatibility of the use of the Fund with the internal market, which shall be addressed to the Board and to the national resolution authorities of the Member State or Member States concerned. That decision may be contingent on conditions, commitments or undertakings in respect of the beneficiary. The decision may also lay down obligations on the Board, the national resolution authorities in the participating Member State or Member States concerned or the beneficiary to enable compliance with it to be monitored. This may include requirements for the appointment of a trustee or other independent person to assist in monitoring. A trustee or other independent person may perform such functions as may be specified in the Commission decision. Any decision pursuant to this paragraph shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The Commission may issue a negative decision, addressed to the Board, where it decides that the proposed use of the Fund would be incompatible with the internal market and cannot be implemented in the form proposed by the Board. On receipt of such a decision the Board shall reconsider its resolution scheme and prepare a revised resolution scheme. 4. Where the Commission has serious doubts as to whether its decision under paragraph 3 is being complied with, it shall conduct the necessary investigations. For that purpose, the Commission may exercise such powers as are available to it under the regulations and other measures referred to in the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 3, and shall be guided by them. 5. If, on the basis of the investigations carried out by the Commission, and after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission considers that the decision under paragraph 3 has not been complied with, it shall issue a decision to the national resolution authority in the participating Member State concerned requiring that authority to recover the misused amounts within a period to be determined by the Commission. The Fund aid to be recovered pursuant to a recovery decision shall include interest at an appropriate rate fixed by the Commission and shall be paid over to the Board. The Board shall pay any amounts received under the first subparagraph into the Fund and take such amounts into consideration when determining contributions in accordance with Articles 70 and 71. The recovery procedure referred to in the first subparagraph shall respect the right to good administration and the right of access to documents, of the beneficiaries, as laid down in Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter. 30.7.2014 L 225 44 Official Journal of the European Union EN  6. Without prejudice to the reporting obligations that the Commission may establish in its decision under paragraph 3 of this Article, the Board shall submit to the Commission annual reports assessing the compliance of the use of the Fund with the decision under that paragraph, for the drawing up of which the Board shall make use of its powers under Article 34. 7. Any Member State or any person, undertaking or association whose interests may be affected by the use of the Fund, in particular the entities referred to in Article 2, shall have the right to inform the Commission of any suspected misuse of the Fund incompatible with the decision under paragraph 3 of this Article. 8. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 93 concerning detailed rules of procedure concerning a the calculation of the interest rate to be applied in the event of a recovery decision in accordance with paragraph 5 b the guarantees of the right to good administration and the right of access to documents referred to in paragraph 5. 9. Where the Commission, following a recommendation of the Board or on its own initiative, considers that the application of resolution tools and actions does not respond to the criteria on the basis of which its initial decision under paragraph 3 was made, it may review such a decision and adopt the appropriate amendments. 10. By way of derogation from paragraph 3, on application by a Member State, the Council may, acting unanimously, decide that the use of the Fund shall be considered to be compatible with the internal market, if such a decision is justi fied by exceptional circumstances. If, however, the Council has not made its attitude known within seven days of the said application being made, the Commission shall give its decision on the case. 11. Participating Member States shall ensure that their national resolution authorities have the powers necessary to ensure compliance with any conditions laid down in a Commission decision pursuant to paragraph 3 and to recover misused amounts pursuant to a Commission decision under paragraph 5. Article 20 Valuation for the purposes of resolution 1. Before deciding on resolution action or the exercise of the power to write down or convert relevant capital instru ments, the Board shall ensure that a fair, prudent and realistic valuation of the assets and liabilities of an entity referred to in Article 2 is carried out by a person independent from any public authority, including the Board and the national resolution authority, and from the entity concerned. 2. Subject to paragraph 15, where all of the requirements laid down in paragraphs 1 and 4 to 9 are met, the valua tion shall be considered to be definitive. 3. Where an independent valuation in accordance with paragraph 1 is not possible, the Board may carry out a provi sional valuation of the assets and liabilities of the entity referred to in Article 2, in accordance with paragraph 10 of this Article. 4. The objective of the valuation shall be to assess the value of the assets and liabilities of an entity referred to in Article 2 that meets the conditions for resolution of Articles 16 and 18. 5. The purposes of the valuation shall be a to inform the determination of whether the conditions for resolution or the conditions for the write down or conversion of capital instruments are met b if the conditions for resolution are met, to inform the decision on the appropriate resolution action to be taken in respect of an entity referred to in Article 2 c when the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments is applied, to inform the decision on the extent of the cancellation or dilution of instruments of ownership, and the extent of the write down or conversion of relevant capital instruments d when the bail in tool is applied, to inform the decision on the extent of the write down or conversion of eligible liabilities 30.7.2014 L 225 45 Official Journal of the European Union EN   e when the bridge institution tool or asset separation tool is applied, to inform the decision on the assets, rights, liabil ities or instruments of ownership to be transferred and the decision on the value of any consideration to be paid to the institution under resolution or, as the case may be, to the owners of the instruments of ownership f when the sale of business tool is applied, to inform the decision on the assets, rights, liabilities or instruments of ownership to be transferred and to inform the Board s understanding of what constitutes commercial terms for the purposes of Article 24 2 b g in all cases, to ensure that any losses on the assets of an entity referred to in Article 2 are fully recognised at the moment the resolution tools are applied or the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments is exer cised. 6. Without prejudice to the Union State aid framework, where applicable, the valuation shall be based on prudent assumptions, including as to rates of default and severity of losses. The valuation shall not assume any potential future provision of any extraordinary public financial support, any central bank emergency liquidity assistance, or any central bank liquidity assistance provided under non standard collateralisation, tenor and interest rate terms to an entity referred to in Article 2 from the point at which resolution action is taken or the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments is exercised. Furthermore, the valuation shall take account of the fact that, if any resolution tool is applied a the Board may recover any reasonable expenses properly incurred from the institution under resolution, in accord ance with Article 22 6 b the Fund may charge interest or fees in respect of any loans or guarantees provided to the institution under reso lution, in accordance with Article 76. 7. The valuation shall be supplemented by the following information as appearing in the accounting books and records of an entity referred to in Article 2 a an updated balance sheet and a report on the financial position of an entity referred to in Article 2 b an analysis and an estimate of the accounting value of the assets c the list of outstanding on balance sheet and off balance sheet liabilities shown in the books and records of an entity referred to in Article 2, with an indication of the respective credits and priority of claims referred to in Article 17. 8. Where appropriate, to inform the decisions referred to in paragraph 5 e and f of this Article, the information in paragraph 7 b of this Article may be complemented by an analysis and estimate of the value of the assets and liabilities of an entity referred to in Article 2 on a market value basis. 9. The valuation shall indicate the subdivision of the creditors in classes in accordance with the priority of claims referred to in Article 17 and an estimate of the treatment that each class of shareholders and creditors would have been expected to receive, if an entity referred to in Article 2 were wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. That esti mate shall not affect the application of the no creditor worse off principle referred to in Article 15 1 g . 10. Where, due to urgency in the circumstances of the case, either it is not possible to comply with the requirements laid down in paragraphs 7 and 9, or paragraph 3 applies, a provisional valuation shall be carried out. The provisional valuation shall comply with the requirements laid down in paragraph 4 and, in so far as reasonably practicable in the circumstances, with the requirements laid down in paragraphs 1, 7 and 9. The provisional valuation referred to in the first subparagraph shall include a buffer for additional losses, with appro priate justification. 11. A valuation that does not comply with all of the requirements laid down in paragraphs 1 and 4 to 9 shall be considered to be provisional until an independent person as referred to in paragraph 1 has carried out a valuation that is fully compliant with all of the requirements laid down in those paragraphs. That ex post definitive valuation shall be carried out as soon as practicable. It may be carried out either separately from the valuation referred to in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18, or simultaneously with and by the same independent person as that valuation, but shall be distinct from it. 30.7.2014 L 225 46 Official Journal of the European Union EN  The purposes of the ex post definitive valuation shall be a to ensure that any losses on the assets of an entity referred to in Article 2 are fully recognised in the books of accounts of that entity b to inform the decision to write back creditors claims or to increase the value of the consideration paid, in accord ance with paragraph 12 of this Article. 12.

For the purposes of assessing whether shareholders and creditors would have received better treatment if the institution under resolution had entered into normal insolvency proceedings, the Board shall ensure that a valuation is carried out by an independent person as referred to in paragraph 1 as soon as possible after the resolution action or actions have been effected. That valuation shall be distinct from the valuation carried out under paragraphs 1 to 15. 17.

The assessment referred to in the first subparagraph shall establish the amount by which eligible liabilities need to be written down or converted in order to restore the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of the institution under reso lution, or, where applicable, establish the ratio of the bridge institution taking into account any contribution of capital by the Fund pursuant to point d of Article 76 1 , and to sustain sufficient market confidence in the institution under resolution or the bridge institution and enable it to continue to meet, for at least one year, the conditions for authorisa tion and to continue to carry out the activities for which it is authorised under Directive 2013 36 EU or Directive 2014 65 EU.
