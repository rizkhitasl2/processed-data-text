To achieve this, the design and implementation of the Australian Government s policies, programs, services and regulations needs to be supported by a robust evidence base. In an increasingly complex economic environment, it is more important than ever that this is underpinned by high quality data analysis and visualisation. The Data Strategy 2021 2024 builds on the department s existing data capabilities and lessons learned from recent experiences to guide us through the next phase of our data evolution. Working in alignment with our Digital Strategy 2021 23, this Strategy outlines how we will continue fostering innovative ways of working that encourage all employees to make the most of our data capabilities and resources. Under the Strategy, we will continue to grow a sustainable data driven culture and maximise the data capabilities of all employees, from basic through to advanced data users. By giving our people the tools and skills they need to undertake data analytics and produce high quality visualisations, we will be better able to communicate insights from data to design and deliver robust, evidence based policies and programs. We will increase our collection of high quality location data and ensure we have the tools and capability to use it. This will help us provide location specific insights, tailor programs to the diverse and specific circumstances and needs of all Australians, and understand the impact of initiatives across the country. As we deal with more data than ever before, this Strategy will also guide our efforts to optimise the department s governance, management and security processes. By ensuring our data assets are well managed and easily accessible to employees, we will increase their value. Data is a key part of everything we do. This Strategy ushers in an exciting new phase in our evolution as a data driven organisation. By the end of 2024, we will have advanced data activity in our department to ensure the best evidence is readily available and consistently used. This will drive strategic decisions at all levels and deliver positive outcomes for the Australian economy in an ever changing landscape.

Data Strategy 2021 2024 Data driven advice to support our strategic priorities  4 1. Capability and culture from data literacy to data fluency People are at the core of our strategy. We can only progress a sustainable data driven culture by maximising the data capabilities of employees across the department. Through this strategy we will build on our strong foundation of broad data literacy to achieve greater data fluency. Data fluency is more than knowing how to access and use data. It includes n knowing what data to use to solve problems n applying critical thinking to understand and address data s strengths and limitations n using data strategically to shape policy and deliver effective programs, regulations and services and n using data to tell a compelling story. We will achieve data fluency by continuing to equip all employees with data skills. By helping employees at all levels think critically about the data they need to support the department s activities, we will create a more mature data culture. Key initiatives and activities Equip and empower employees with data skills and capabilities n Provide learning and development opportunities for all employees. Opportunities range from broad skills for basic data users to specialised training for advanced data users. This links to the APS Data Professional Stream, particularly the initiatives to develop sophisticated data users and establish a Data Professional Network. n Share examples of best practice data use across the department. n Engage in data workforce planning across government. This will enable recruitment, retention and ongoing development of employees with data capabilities across the department and APS. Help senior leaders foster a data driven approach n Extend data training opportunities for Senior Executive Service SES employees in line with the APS Data Professional Stream initiative to embed data capability across the SES.. n Regularly update executives on key data capability measures and opportunities to improve data capability across the department, including through the department s Data Governance Board. Raise awareness of the Data Policy Branch s services and training n Create accessible content that promotes data services and training available for employees. n Identify opportunities for peer to peer data advocacy and coaching across the department. n Share examples of good data use across the department. n Clarify the Data Policy Branch s key activities and services, including guidelines on when and how they can offer support. n Update our Data Capability Framework to include more roles and promote new informal learning opportunities. Influence data policy and the public data agenda across the APS n Continue collaborating with other agencies to shape the whole of government data agenda. n Promote activities relevant to the whole of government data agenda to all employees. We will focus on activities that improve our data capability, including relevant data sharing opportunities. Capability and culture in practice Nicola works in the Climate Change Division. She was interested in learning more about working with data in Power BI. With her manager s support, Nicola enrolled in our Power BI Bootcamp. Using the skills and knowledge she gained, she was able to completely reshape the way Australia reports emissions data. Nicola and the Climate Change Division used Power BI to produce an interactive graph showing emissions by quarter and sector. This graph is now a key part of our National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Quarterly Updates. Data Strategy 2021 2024 Data driven advice to support our strategic priorities  5 2. Governance optimise our data governance and management Data governance means having authority and control over data assets, including planning, monitoring and following best practice. It guides all other data management functions including metadata management, data quality and data security. Our Data Governance Framework sets out the rules, processes and roles that help us ensure robust data management and governance practices. Good data governance minimises risk, establishes rules for using data, helps us meet compliance requirements, improves communication, increases the value of data, and reduces the cost of managing data. Our data management and governance is already mature. To date we have focused on compliance with our data standards, and identifying and managing data for analytics. We have also established a Data Governance Board made up of departmental executives to champion the effective, safe and ethical use of data. However, the amount of data we are responsible for is growing. This creates new challenges for employees to navigate, analyse and interpret data appropriately. Given this, we need to improve our data governance to n ensure the security of our data holdings n improve evidence based advice n use automation to minimise manual intervention and human error n continue considering the whole data lifecycle n prioritise our most important data assets and n be more dynamic. Key initiatives and activities Make data assets more discoverable and accessible n Ensure the department collects key metadata in line with our data standards. n Improve data cataloguing. This includes being able to search for datasets and access metadata and documentation related to data assets. n Make data easier to find and access on DataHub, our internal data repository. This will help employees use the right data for the right purpose. Make data governance more efficient n Proactively develop our current and emerging priority data assets to better connect activities with business and economic outcomes. n Use automation to reduce the administrative burden of governing and managing our assets. n Update our data governance framework and implement a self service governance model for data stewards and custodians. Ensure data is governed, well managed and secure across the whole data lifecycle n Ensure good governance for data systems we design and develop. This includes data security and risk management approaches in line with the Digital Transformation Agency s whole of government Hosting Strategy and the department s Digital Strategy 2021 23. n Update our data collection standards, including incorporating relevant national and international standards. n Review and streamline data management practices, including certifying data and collecting core data items, to ensure they are fit for purpose. n Finalise and implement our Data Quality Framework so that data quality issues are managed consistently across the department. Data governance in practice Sarah wanted to include data about support for small to medium businesses in a policy proposal. She used our dataset register to access information about the Entrepreneurs Programme Accelerating Commercialisation Grants internal dataset. She contacted the data steward listed on the dataset, who checked and cleared the data in Sarah s proposal. Sarah could then finalise the briefing, confident she is using accurate data that can be shared. Data Strategy 2021 2024 Data driven advice to support our strategic priorities  6 3. Analytics best practice, fit for purpose analytics Analytics lets us turn data into useable information, which is critical for developing and delivering evidence based policy. The Australian Government and community expect us to use data to develop, implement and evaluate policies and programs. We significantly improved our analytical capability under the previous data strategy. This included creating our Data Analytics Framework a guide to best practice data analytics in the department. Under this strategy we will n Embed analytics and visualisation capability at all levels of the department n Modernise our data analysis processes to ensure they are fit for purpose and serve our strategic goals n Give employees the tools and support they need for data analytics and visualisation that provide robust evidence using the best available data n Continue to foster an analytics rich culture and n Improve our analytical capabilities and make advanced analytics tools available to all employees. Key initiatives and activities Embed best practice analytics across the department n Identify the analytics needs and data sources that support each business area s priorities. n Contribute to the new energy technologies 2020 21 Budget measure to improve energy and emissions data analytics, tools and reporting in alignment with the department s Digital Strategy 2021 23. n Encourage employees to use data visualisation when communicating policy. n Provide learning and development opportunities that help employees use data analytics and visualisation to construct arguments. n Promote the Data Analytics Framework and what it means for employees. n Develop and promote case studies that highlight important analytics work and global best practice.

Data analytics in practice Our Fraud and Audit team had to manually check large numbers of grant applications for fraud indicators. Wanting to improve the process, they developed a proof of concept system that used advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to check applications. Drawing on existing departmental datasets, the system showed that we can use data science techniques to automatically identify potential fraud indicators in grant applications. Data Strategy 2021 2024 Data driven advice to support our strategic priorities  7 4. Location based insights enable greater use of location data Everything that happens, happens somewhere, and location data often called geospatial or spatial data is that somewhere. We regularly collect, manage and use location data when dealing with businesses and stakeholders. We now have an opportunity to improve how we collect location data and the tools we use to analyse and visualise it. By 2024, we will n be collecting high quality, fit for purpose, spatially accurate location data n have the tools and capability to effectively manage, analyse and visualise this data and n be using location data more effectively to provide insights, tailor policies and programs, and understand the impact of initiatives in particular locations. Key initiatives and activities Increase awareness of the value of location data and location data support services n Develop communications to raise awareness on what location data is and why it is important. We will also promote the analytical capabilities, tools and support available to help employees use location data. Improved tools and capability to collect and use location data n Promote best practice approaches for collecting, managing and using location data. This includes no longer using postcodes as a key method our main method of identifying location. n Work with data custodians to improve location elements in our data holdings. This includes better address validation and geocoding processes when collecting data. n Scope and implement better geocoding and analysis tools in alignment with the department s Digital Strategy 2021 23. n Scope and provide ongoing resources for specialist location data technical support, including mapping and analysing data. n Provide training resources to employees for basic location data analysis, mapping and visualisation. n Offer employees the chance to shadow our location analysis specialists. This will help build ongoing location data capability in the department. Influence location data policy, practice and capability across government n Participate in department and whole of government policy and capability location forums. n Collaborate with other government agencies on location data analysis, mapping and visualisation. Location data in practice The devastating 2019 20 bushfires highlighted how we can use location data to make quick decisions and deliver better services. At the height of the bushfire season, the Analysis and Insights Division linked a range of spatial, emergency, demographic and business datasets, including n Emergency Management Spatial Information Network Australia n Geoscience Australia s satellite burn fire scar and Discrete Global Grid System n Australian Business Register n Business Grants Hub data and n data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. By joining these datasets, we were able to quickly identify bushfire affected areas, businesses and industries. This helped us quickly develop and provide support, including a bushfire information hub and targeted business advice through the AusIndustry National Outreach Network.
