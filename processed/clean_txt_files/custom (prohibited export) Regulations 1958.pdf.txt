The amendment history in endnote 4 provides information about amendments at the provision generally section or equivalent level. It also includes information about any provision of the compiled law that has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law. Editorial changes The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date. If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Misdescribed amendments A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section 15V of the Legislation Act 2003. If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and md not incorp is added to the amendment history.
