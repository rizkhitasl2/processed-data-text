Nominal quantity of product Qn in g or mL Tolerable deficiency T a Percent of Qn g or mL 0 to 50 9 50 to 100 4.5 100 to 200 4.5 200 to 300 9 300 to 500 3 500 to 1 000 15 Authorised Version F2019C00581 registered 22 07 2019   Packaging Part 4 Shortfall Division 4.7 Regulation 4.37 National Trade Measurement Regulations 2009 79 Compilation No. 7 Compilation date 1 7 19 Registered 22 7 19 Nominal quantity of product Qn in g or mL Tolerable deficiency T a Percent of Qn g or mL 1 000 to 10 000 1.5 10 000 to 15 000 150 15 000 to 50 000 1 a T values are to be rounded up to the next of a g or mL for Qn 1 000 g or mL and to the next whole g or mL for Qn 1 000 g or mL Nominal quantity of product Qn in length Percent of Qn Qn 5 m No tolerable deficiency allowed Qn 5 m 2 Nominal quantity of product Qn in area Percent of Qn All Qn 3 Nominal quantity of product Qn in count Percent of Qn Qn 50 items No tolerable deficiency allowed Qn 50 items 1 b b Compute the value of T by multiplying the nominal quantity by 1 and rounding the result up to the next whole number. The value may be larger than 1 due to the rounding but this is accepted because the products are whole items and cannot be divided. 4.37 Weighted average quantity The weighted average quantity of the packages in a sample is worked out using the formula x s c where x is the sample mean. s is the standard deviation of the sample. c is the sample correction factor in column 4 of the table in regulation 4.34. 4.38 Test failure 1 For paragraph 20 1 t of the Act, this regulation prescribes circumstances in which a group of prepackages is taken to have failed testing in accordance with AQS test procedures 2 A circumstance is that the weighted average quantity of product in the sample of prepackages is less than the nominal quantity.

Note This is also known as a T1 error. An inadequate prepackage that is found to contain an actual quantity less than the nominal quantity minus the tolerable deficiency for the nominal quantity has a T1 error. 4 A circumstance is that 1 or more inadequate prepackages in the sample contains a quantity of product less than Qn T2, where T2 is equal to 2 T. Note 1 This is also known as a T2 error. An inadequate prepackage that is found to contain an actual quantity less than the nominal quantity minus twice the tolerable deficiency for the nominal quantity has a T2 error. Note 2 The effect of this regulation is that an inspection lot a will be accepted if none of the circumstances exists and b will be rejected if 1 or more of the circumstances exists.
