COURT, Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 19 thereof, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the fifth paragraph of Article 254 thereof, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a 1 thereof, Having regard to the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and in particular the sixth paragraph of Article 19, Article 63 and the second paragraph of Article 64 thereof, Whereas 1 The Rules of Procedure of 2 May 1991 have been amended numerous times in order to equip the General Court gradually with provisions enabling it to deal under the best possible conditions with different kinds of cases falling within increasingly varied areas. 2 Full revision of the text is necessary in order to give this set of rules a new coherence, to promote consistency in the procedural provisions governing proceedings brought before the Courts of the European Union, to preserve the capacity of the General Court to rule on cases within a reasonable time, to clarify parties rights, to specify the General Court s expectations regarding the parties representatives and to adjust a certain number of provisions to take account of certain changes, including technological changes, in relation to the lodging and service of procedural documents, and of difficulties encountered in their implementation. 3 Actions brought in the field of intellectual property and appeals lodged against decisions of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal must, on account of their specific nature, be subject to particular procedural rules set out in special titles, while being otherwise governed by the procedural provisions applicable to direct actions. The rules relating to direct actions, actions in the field of intellectual property and appeals therefore constitute the framework of these Rules. 4 In the light of experience, it is also necessary to supplement or to clarify for the benefit of litigants the rules that apply to each procedure. The rules in question concern, in particular, the extent of the rights conferred on the main parties and that of the rights afforded to interveners or, in intellectual property cases, the acquisition of the status of intervener and the extent of his rights. Observance of the adversarial principle and the need, in certain situations, to preserve the confidentiality of sensitive information which is relevant to the outcome of the proceedings are the subject of specific provisions. With regard to appeals against decisions of the Civil Service Tribunal, a clearer distinction must in addition be drawn between appeals and cross appeals following the service of an appeal. A similar distinction must be drawn, with regard to cases in the field of intellectual property, between the original action and the cross claim brought by an intervener, following service of the application initiating proceedings. 5 The excessive complexity of certain procedures has come to light on their implementation. It is appropriate, therefore, to simplify them. On that basis, the rules for determining the language of the case in intellectual property cases ensure greater predictability of situations for the benefit of those concerned and a light touch by the General Court. The rules relating to the default procedure are intended to enable cases to be disposed of more promptly, in the interests of the applicant, who, if successful, is exposed to the risk of the defendant applying for the judgment in default to be set aside. 6 In the interests of making the Rules easier to understand, all requests and applications relating to judgments and orders, currently to be found in a number of separate titles and chapters of the Rules of Procedure, should be brought together in the title relating to direct actions. Similarly, to assist the reader, the procedures following referral by the Court of Justice, either after a decision has been set aside, or after review, are set out in a single title. 7 Although required to deal with an ever increasing caseload, the General Court must continue to deliver its rulings within a reasonable time. It is therefore essential to continue the efforts undertaken to reduce the duration of proceedings before the General Court, in particular by providing for the written part of the procedure in 23.4.2015 L 105 9 Official Journal of the European Union EN  intellectual property cases to be limited to a single exchange of pleadings, managing applications to modify the form of order sought in the application, reducing certain legal time limits, simplifying the rules on intervention by removing as a category of intervention those which may be allowed after expiry of the legal time limit following publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, making provision for the General Court to be able to rule without an oral part of the procedure in direct actions if none of the main parties has requested a hearing and if it considers that it has sufficient information available to it from the material in the file in the case, and to be able to rule without an oral part of the procedure in appeals, increasing the decision making powers of the Presidents of Chambers and, lastly, increasing the circumstances in which a ruling is to be given by means of a simple decision. 8 With the same objective, provisions have been added to the title relating to the organisation of the General Court with a view, in particular, to specifying the circumstances in which a case may be reassigned and extending the powers of a single Judge so as to enable him to hear and determine intellectual property cases. 9 The fact that proceedings are to be conducted in accordance with the adversarial principle is confirmed by the affirmation of that principle in a specific article and by a strict set of rules governing the circumstances in which preservation of the confidentiality of certain information provided by a main party which is necessary in order for the General Court to rule in the case justifies, exceptionally, the non communication of that information to the other main party. New provisions also provide the General Court with a formal framework in the event of a Judge s withdrawal from a case or of his being excused. The reform is also intended to elevate to the status of rules of procedure provisions which were previously contained in practice directions to parties, such as that relating to the length of pleadings, or in instructions to the registrar of the General Court, such as the provision concerning anonymity and that specifying the circumstances in which a third party may be given access to the file in the case. 10 Lastly, the text has been made easier to read by the removal of certain rules which are outdated or not applied, the numbering of every paragraph of the articles in these Rules, the addition of a specific heading for each article and the harmonisation of terminology, With the agreement of the Court of Justice, With the approval of the Council given on 10 February 2015, HAS ADOPTED THESE RULES OF PROCEDURE INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS Article 1 Definitions 1.

Where the General Court concludes in the examination provided for in paragraph 1 that certain information or material produced before it is relevant in order for it to rule in the case and is confidential vis Ã  vis the other main party, it shall weigh that confidentiality against the requirements linked to the right to effective judicial protection, particularly observance of the adversarial principle. 3. After weighing up the matters referred to in paragraph 2, the General Court may decide to bring the confidential information or material to the attention of the other main party, making its disclosure subject, if necessary, to the giving of specific undertakings, or it may decide not to communicate such information or material, specifying, by reasoned order, the procedures enabling the other main party, to the greatest extent possible, to make his views known, including ordering the production of a non confidential version or a non confidential summary of the information or material, containing the essential content thereof. 23.4.2015 L 105 36 Official Journal of the European Union EN  4.

Where, contrary to the adversarial principle set out in Article 64 under which all information and material must be fully communicated between the parties, a main party intends to base his claims on certain information or material but submits that its communication would harm the security of the Union or that of one or more of its Member States or the conduct of their international relations, he shall produce that information or material by a separate document. The information or material thus produced shall be accompanied by an application for confidential treatment thereof, setting out the overriding reasons which, to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, justify the confidentiality of that information or material being preserved and which militate against its communication to the other main party. The application for confidential treatment shall also be submitted by a separate document and shall not contain anything which is confidential. Where the information or material in respect of which confidential treatment is sought has been transmitted to the main party by one or more Member States, the overriding reasons put forward by the main party to justify the confidential treatment of that information or material may include those provided by the Member State s concerned. 2. The production of information or material the confidential nature of which is based on the overriding reasons referred to in paragraph 1 may be requested by the General Court in the form of a measure of inquiry. Formal note shall be taken of any refusal. By way of derogation from Article 103, the procedural regime applicable to such information or material produced following a measure of inquiry shall be that of the present Article. 3. While the information or material produced by a main party in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 is being examined as to its relevance to the General Court s ruling in the case and as to its confidential nature vis Ã  vis the other main party, that information or material shall not be communicated to the other main party. 4. Where the General Court decides, after the examination provided for in paragraph 3, that the information or material produced before it is relevant in order for it to rule in the case and is not confidential for the purposes of the proceedings before the General Court, it shall ask the party concerned to authorise the communication of that information or material to the other main party. If the first party objects to such communication within a period prescribed by the President, or fails to reply by the end of that period, that information or material shall not be taken into account in the determination of the case and shall be returned to that party. 5. Where the General Court decides, after the examination provided for in paragraph 3, that certain information or material produced before it is relevant in order for it to rule in the case and is confidential vis Ã  vis the other main party, it shall not communicate that information or material to that main party. It shall then weigh the requirements linked to the right to effective judicial protection, particularly observance of the adversarial principle, against the requirements flowing from the security of the Union or of one or more of its Member States or the conduct of their international relations. 6. After weighing up the matters referred to in paragraph 5, the General Court shall make a reasoned order specifying the procedures to be adopted to accommodate the requirements referred to in paragraph 5, such as the production by the party concerned, for subsequent communication to the other main party, of a non confidential version or a non confidential summary of the information or material, containing the essential content thereof and enabling the other main party, to the greatest extent possible, to make its views known. 23.4.2015 L 105 37 Official Journal of the European Union EN  7. The information or material that is confidential vis Ã  vis the other main party may be withdrawn, wholly or in part, by the main party who produced it in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2, within two weeks after service of the decision taken pursuant to paragraph 5. The information or material withdrawn shall not be taken into account in the determination of the case and shall be returned to the main party concerned. 8. Where the General Court considers that information or material which, owing to its confidential nature, has not been communicated to the other main party in accordance with the procedures referred to in paragraph 6 is essential in order for it to rule in the case, it may, by way of derogation from Article 64 and confining itself to what is strictly necessary, base its judgment on such information or material. When assessing that information or material, the General Court shall take account of the fact that a main party has not been able to make his views on it known. 9.
