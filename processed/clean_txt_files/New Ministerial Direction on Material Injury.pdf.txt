 AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS DUMPING NOTICE NO.2012 24 New Ministerial Direction on Material Injury On 22 June 2011, the Australian Government announced its Streamlining Australia s anti dumping system policy. This announcement included a commitment to revise the current Ministerial Direction on Material Injury to confirm that profits foregone and loss of market share in an expanding market are relevant injury considerations. The previous guidance on material injury was based on a Ministerial Direction from former Minister Beddall in 1990 and two letters from then Minister Button and Minister Vanstone in 1991 and 2000 respectively. In an effort to consolidate the previous guidance, and deliver on the Government s commitment to streamline the anti dumping system, the Minister for Home Affairs has issued a new Ministerial Direction under section 269TA of the Customs Act 1901 the Act . The new Ministerial Direction includes the following key points from the previous guidance material injury is injury which is not immaterial, insubstantial or insignificant the injury must be greater than that likely to occur in the normal ebb and flow of business identifying material injury will depend on the circumstances of each case injury caused by other factors must not be attributed to dumping or subsidisation, however dumping or subsidisation need not be the sole cause of injury to the industry and it is important to consider regional dumping, the greater impact of injury during periods of economic downturn and reduced rates of growth as an element of injury. The new Ministerial Direction also recognises that there may be circumstances where dumping or subsidisation may still result in injury where it has caused the rate of an industry s growth to slow, without causing it to contract, or where an industry suffers a loss of market share in a growing market, without a decline in profits. Under the terms of subsection 269TA 1 of the Act, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is bound to comply with the new Ministerial Direction, a copy of which is attached for reference.
