Industry, innovation and science drive economic growth and job creation in Australia, which in turn support Australians standards of living. Because of these responsibilities, the department has a central role in promoting a globally integrated, digital and technology driven economy. Australia has experienced 28 years of economic growth however, we cannot afford to be complacent. Our operating environment is changing rapidly. Global economic trends will continue to impact Australia, and we need to grow businesses that can navigate the changes in the global economy and use technology to drive Australia s productivity and competitiveness. We work to implement the Government s economic agenda by enabling the growth of globally competitive businesses to support job creation and a strong economy and provide a foundation for our security. We also play an important role in delivering trusted and efficient services to businesses. Our efforts depend on connecting agendas across government and maintaining strong relationships with businesses, employees, the science community, regulators and international partners. This is complemented by taking citizen centred approaches to developing, implementing and communicating policy. The department s focus is on helping Australian businesses to navigate market disruptions and seek new opportunities, including those presented by digital transformation. Advances in core and emerging industries from space to biotechnology have the potential to create new jobs, raise incomes and deliver a better quality of life for all Australians. This year, we will continue to support the competitiveness of these industries, with the implementation of the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund a key focus. We are also looking to improve the way we engage with, and encourage the development of, innovative and potentially disruptive technologies, particularly through approaches to artificial intelligence. We promote the global competitiveness of our resources sector, which remains one of the foundations of our national wealth. We will implement the National Resources Statement as the blueprint for growth in our resources sector, as well as working to build the skills and data we need to unlock new opportunities. We are also helping to develop the National Hydrogen Strategy to examine how Australia can fast track the development of this industry and open up export markets in the Indo Pacific region. At the same time, we are leading the Government s efforts to unlock the untapped potential of northern Australia and build on its strong primary and tourism industries, along with its connections to our regional neighbours. The department is also focused on building a more competitive business environment, including through reforms to reduce the cost of doing business, particularly by providing simple, easy to access services and information and helping business seamlessly engage with government. With rapid technological advances, we also need to ensure our regulatory systems are fit for purpose and promote digital innovation while safeguarding the Australian community. We also invest in and support scientific research, infrastructure, skills development, collaboration and engagement that underpins new discoveries. Our portfolio is supporting research agencies to ensure they are well positioned to undertake high quality research for Australia. We are continuing to facilitate strong innovation and science connections internationally. Through the Global Innovation Strategy, we are helping Australia grow institutional connections that support frontier science responding to global challenges related to technology disruption, health, food and energy supply and the environment. This year, the Australian Government will release the recommendations arising from the Independent Review of the Australian Public Service APS and the Government s response to the Review. We are strongly dedicated to building a fit for purpose APS that meets the needs of governments and Australians into the future. As a portfolio, we are committed to working directly with business and the community to resolve real world problems and to seize opportunities together. We will partner with more sectors and use more citizen centred and co designed policy to develop, implement and communicate policies and programs that create an environment that supports growth and technological advancement across all regions. A key aspect of this work will be to continue to deliver valuable services to business and the community through AusIndustry, our shared services networks, policy and regulatory efforts. We will work closely with partners across government to ensure Australians and Australian business are able to access the seamless, effective services they need quickly and easily. That is why the department is working to build evaluation into every aspect of our work and to use data innovatively to drive more effective outcomes. Making greater use of data will ensure governments can be confident they have the right policy design and programs supporting the right people at the right time. I am committed to continuing to support a safe, inclusive and diverse organisation. The department embraces the diverse backgrounds, life and work experiences of our staff to enhance the richness of our workplace. Through our programs, policies and services we also provide mutually beneficial opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, organisations and communities across Australia to share in economic development and social inclusion.  Department of Industry, Innovation and Science Corporate Plan 2019 20 2 By continuing to invest in building the right capabilities, cultures and connections around the key areas of industry, innovation, science and technology we can create jobs for the future and promote a dynamic and successful Australian economy. I look forward to collaborating across government, business and the community to continue delivering positive outcomes for all Australians. Dr Heather Smith PSM Secretary Department of Industry, Innovation and Science  Department of Industry, Innovation and Science Corporate Plan 2019 20 3 Our Vision Supporting economic growth and job creation for all Australians  Department of Industry, Innovation and Science Corporate Plan 2019 20 4 PURPOSE 1 Supporting science and commercialisation PURPOSE 2 Growing business investment and improving business capability PURPOSE 3 Simplifying doing business OUR PURPOSES We aim to fulfil our vision through three purposes Many external factors will affect the outcomes we are seeking to influence through our three purposes. These include the global strategic and economic environment, emerging developments across science and technology, the contributions of other actors and domestic economic and fiscal conditions. A key part of our role is to create positive outcomes for the Australian economy within a complex operating environment. We will do this by ensuring robust policy design informed by evidence and the needs of the Australian public. Success in achieving our purposes will help improve the following aspects of the Australian economy Economic growth Job creation Productivity n Growth in gross domestic product n Growth in gross value added by industry n Growth in employment n Growth in total hours worked n Growth in labour productivity n Growth in multifactor productivity such as efficient use of labour and capital  Department of Industry, Innovation and Science Corporate Plan 2019 20 5 OUR STRATEGIC ACTIVITIES We are responsible for a diverse range of strategic activities that contribute to our purposes to help Australian business and industries to grow and prosper. We will measure our success against how we influence and aid Australia s growth, economic resilience and transformation and uptake of emerging opportunities for the wellbeing of all Australians.

Australian Government, Canberra 8 AlphaBeta 2018 Future Skills Report. Available at The Australian economy is evolving rapidly, driven by new technology, shifting demographics and changing consumer preferences. Australia has enjoyed 28 uninterrupted years of economic growth. Job creation is high, with 1.2 million new jobs created in the last five years1, unemployment is relatively low at 5.1 per cent2 and the federal Budget is projected to return to surplus next financial year. We are also facing global economic challenges that will impact Australian businesses and the community more generally. Weak wage growth3, rising costs of living4 and a protracted slowdown in productivity performance are all placing a strain on households and businesses. The department helps to address these challenges by working with key partners across the economy to drive future growth and business capability development. We do this by supporting businesses to innovate and adopt new technologies, encouraging business research collaborations to develop and share new ideas and helping businesses access new markets. We are in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution, marked by the transformative technologies associated with digitisation, automation, big data and artificial intelligence. Technology is key to improving the productivity and competitiveness of Australian businesses, and advances in these transformative technologies have the potential to create new jobs, raise incomes, and deliver a better quality of life for all Australians. Australia s ongoing economic success and standards of living depend on our ability to ethically harness technological advances. Data 61 estimates that improvements to existing industries and growth of new industries could be worth 315 billion to the Australian economy over the next decade.5 As a department, we have a key role in bringing together expertise across the business and research communities to develop and share new tools and technologies. Science and research will continue to drive advancements in knowledge and improvements in living standards as new discoveries are made and applied, while governments and industry look to scientific knowledge and skills to meet local and national needs. Australian businesses are our major investors in research, spending 16.6 billion in 2015 16 and employing over 70,000 full time equivalent research staff.6 Our challenge is to drive further investment, enabling strong commercial returns from research and encouraging innovation across the economy. To achieve this, business and government must work in partnership with the community. The department supports this by leading and influencing key policy settings, helping to set a vision for the future, and establishing institutional arrangements, rules and regulations. As technology brings the world closer together, global competition is intensifying. Australia must navigate changing strategic and trade dynamics in the Indo Pacific and increase our economic security as a core component of our national security. With the growing importance of regional partnerships, the department helps build valuable international networks and supports Australia s scientific community to showcase our scientific and technological excellence at home and abroad. The department also helps SMEs access export markets to become more globally competitive. Australia s globally competitive resources sector underpins much of our prosperity and delivers benefits for our communities, particularly in regional Australia. Together with mining services, the resources sector makes up over 8 per cent of Australia s economy and generates over 200 billion in exports7 per annum. However, competitive pressures in the resources sector are expected to intensify. Investment attraction, technological development, and the portfolio s ongoing work to provide an effective and safe regulatory environment will all be critical as we seek to develop new resource projects and expand into new markets. Ultimately, our ability to take advantage of these global shifts will come down to the skills of our workforce. Improving skills, including supporting basic science, technology, engineering and maths STEM skills for all, is fundamental to getting more Australians secure good jobs in a changing economy. By 2040, we expect that Australians will on average acquire 41 per cent of their knowledge and skills after they turn 21, up from 19 per cent today.8 As careers become more diverse and technology opens up new ways of working, we will need to increase our commitment to life long learning, digital literacy and better business management. Australian businesses, governments and workers will all have an important role to play in this.  Department of Industry, Innovation and Science Corporate Plan 2019 20 7 ROLES AND FUNCTIONS Our primary role includes policy and program development that supports Australian industry, innovation and science. To do this we take the lead on national initiatives that aim to grow the economy, create jobs and future proof Australian industries. With global forces and technological change reshaping international and domestic markets, we play a critical role in enabling citizens and businesses to adjust to change and seize new opportunities. We do this through our purposes. Supporting science and commercialisation By investing in science and commercialisation initiatives, we support the creation and sharing of scientific and technological information as input to commercial activity. Our work focuses on policy development initiatives, interventions and projects that n provide incentives for business research, development and commercialisation n facilitate the innovative adoption and diffusion of digital technologies n encourage collaboration between businesses and researchers to drive innovation and contribute to improved productivity.

Department of Industry, Innovation and Science Corporate Plan 2019 20 8 Delivery partners We work to achieve our purposes in partnership with a wide range of stakeholders, including other Australian Government agencies, state and territory governments, local governments, regulators, businesses, industries, researchers, universities, scientific agencies and the wider Australian community. Our work with our state and territory government counterparts, particularly through the Council of Australian Governments COAG Energy Council, helps promote Australia s globally competitive resources sector. This supports best practices in the mining industry to develop Australia s mineral and energy resources. We also coordinate the Government s agenda to unlock the potential of northern Australia and build on its strong primary industries, tourism and access to Asia. We are investing in critical infrastructure, facilitating private investment and developing more opportunities for a range of industries and communities to grow. We are helping businesses to improve their productivity, capabilities and networks. In addition to our work driving innovation and business collaboration, we facilitate business engagement in global value chains and support the development of critical management, entrepreneurial and digital skills. Our work also contributes to the Government s important work to provide an enabling environment for business success. We collaborate with the Australian Tax Office on tax and regulatory reform. This work helps reduce the cost of doing business and supports commercialisation to grow business investment and improve business capability.

Governance Review To ensure we continually improve our business and financial effectiveness, we recently completed a review of the department s corporate governance arrangements. As a result, we have implemented a stronger governance system that ensures our activities better align with government and organisational objectives and fosters n high organisational performance through timely and effective decision making that is aligned with strategic direction and n conformance with legal, policy and community expectations of transparency. A key outcome of the review was a revised governance structure. This new governance structure will support n a cohesive, inclusive enterprise vision and mission to shape objectives and foster an outcomes focused culture n an enterprise level view of priorities, supported by standardised reporting of investments, workforce planning, benefits management and risks n stewardship in decision making n positive engagement with risk to leverage opportunities and drive innovation n an adaptable governance structure which supports organisational agility and is responsive to changes in government priorities. Our new governance structure is at right.

We acknowledge that is a part of doing business and it is incumbent on us to ensure we do so in a considered and effective way to reduce the likelihood of adverse outcomes or their impacts. To achieve our vision, we must be innovative in our policy development, simplify our program delivery and continue to exceed expectations in delivering on the Government s priorities. This means taking measured risks where the potential benefit exceeds the potential downside however, we do not tolerate repeat failures and systemic issues. We recognise that effective risk engagement and risk management must be part of our culture they must be embedded in our policies, processes and systems. This ensures we continue to make good decisions in the face of a complex and uncertain operating environment. Our risk framework Our Risk Management Framework 2018 20 sets out a systematic approach to risk management for all our business operations and staff at all levels. We achieve this through a consultative approach and tools designed to n build organisational risk capability so that risk awareness and effective engagement become part of our mindset and our skillset n embed risk management into business processes and performance management so that risk thinking adds value n drive better knowledge management to improve our performance in achieving our purposes. Risk governance We have established systems of risk oversight, management and internal controls in accordance with section 16 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 and the Commonwealth Risk Management Policy. The Executive Board is responsible for determining and reviewing our risk appetite, tolerance levels and the department s performance in managing risks. The Executive Board is active in identifying emerging risks and provides support to the Secretary in the strategic management of the department s risks. The Assurance and Audit Committee considers the appropriateness of the risk management framework, adequacy of procedures and overall effectiveness of risk management systems and processes, including providing independent advice and assurance to the Executive Board. We undertake periodic risk reviews, reporting results and findings through our departmental governance structures. This includes regular monitoring of and reporting on the risk environment to the Audit Committee and during the business planning and review process. The framework is consistent with the Commonwealth Risk Management Policy and is designed in accordance with the Australian and New Zealand Risk Management Standard ISO 31000 2009, Risk management principles and guidelines.  Department of Industry, Innovation and Science Corporate Plan 2019 20 11 CAPABILITY To meet the Australian Government s priorities, we must be adaptive, proactive and innovative as we work with our stakeholders and the community to find new approaches to a changing environment. We will build our capability to achieve our purposes and realise our vision by investing in our people, values, processes and systems. Policy capability Strategic and robust policy development is crucial to ensuring that the policy advice we provide to the Government is of high quality. In order to meet the expectations of citizens and Ministers, we are continually assessing and improving our policymaking methods and practices. In response to a major review of our policy capability, the department has implemented a number of initiatives to improve our policymaking, including n creating an internal SES governance group that guides departmental policy development and discusses policy issues reflected in new governance arrangements n establishing a new collaborative and strategic approach to developing new policy proposals n developing an organisational policy capability measurement framework n contributing to APS wide improvements in policymaking through our co chairing of the APS Policy Project designed to help APS staff build the policy and implementation skills they will need in a changing work environment. These improvements complement other activities undertaken to improve aspects of policy development, such as n engaging with communities, businesses and citizens in new and better ways n evaluating the impact of programs and policies n deploying data and analytics to build an evidence base for policy development n using human centred design principles and techniques in policy, program and service delivery n growing a strategic communications function. Case study The Australian Public Service Framework for Engagement and Participation Helping public servants to engage better with Australian citizens, community and business As a department, we have designed and are implementing the Australian Public Service Framework for Engagement and Participation. The framework provides guidance and support by establishing engagement principles, standards and Ways to Engage. It emphasises that engagement should not focus solely on managing citizens, stakeholders and their expectations rather, public servants should see Australian citizens as a source of expertise where engagement can forge partnerships that earn trust and overcome complexity. It asks public servants to reflect on what expertise they need to solve the problem at hand, and what engagement will best obtain it. The Framework is timely, because better engagement underpins effective policy, programs and services that earn the trust of the Australian public. To support the framework we are also implementing a Guide to the Right Engagement. This guide will help policy makers by providing different engagement tools and techniques, and helping choose which of these to apply. We are also implementing the Informed Participation deliberative engagement methodology, which will help public servants resolve complex issues that require trade offs, balance competing interests and priorities, and shared action built on public support. People capability and workforce planning To achieve our purposes we will build capability through our people, culture, principles and knowledge. Strong organisational capability will ensure we deliver on government priorities in line with community expectations and prepare for future challenges and opportunities. We will build a diverse and inclusive organisation by n being recognised as a leader in program delivery supported by strong evidence based policy development on matters relevant to Australia s industries n building the evidence to support policy decisions through rigorous economic analysis and research n contributing to the Government s shared and common services program to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of services delivered to government and business n being a leader in delivering open government through engagement and participation n fostering a development culture that builds employee capabilities and creates career opportunities n being a leader in the use of flexible work arrangements to support and drive employee engagement n ensuring our workforce is diverse and reflects the composition of the Australian community n becoming an agency of choice for new and existing employees. Workforce planning Planning a workforce for the future is critical to ensuring there are sufficient numbers of appropriately trained and skilled employees to deliver on the Government s agenda. To meet the demands of a rapidly changing environment we need to develop and maintain a highly skilled, engaged, flexible and innovative workforce.  Department of Industry, Innovation and Science Corporate Plan 2019 20 12 We undertake integrated business and workforce planning activities to ensure we consider our workforce needs in a priority setting. Our workforce strategies will support ongoing development to create a highly capable organisation. These strategies include n rewarding high performance n providing extensive learning and development opportunities n encouraging mobility across the department, the APS and within industry to broaden experience and strengthen capability n supporting the flexible deployment of staff and strategic recruitment to ensure the department has the right people in the right place at the right time n providing a flexible work environment through a variety of initiatives, including teleworking n supporting managers to plan for succession, recruitment and learning and development needs in a strategic way. Mobility Opportunities Network As a department, we are leading the APS Mobility Opportunities Network the Network , which comprises nine departments and agencies across the APS. Mobility across the APS is critical in ensuring staff with the appropriate skills and experience are available to work on priority issues. Mobility also builds individual employee capability. The Network is committed to creating partnerships and collaborating on inter departmental mobility pilot projects across four areas n mobility across the regions n capability development n taskforces n making it easier to be mobile. The nine departments and agencies of the Network will work together to ensure the success of mobility initiatives, as well as identifying and delivering new short to medium term mobility opportunities, across the four work streams. The Network will also work together with the APS Reform Committee and recommendations from the Independent Review of the APS, to further understand reform opportunities and integrate solutions where optimal. Diversity and Inclusion We are committed to creating a more diverse workforce with inclusive work practices. Greater diversity and an inclusive culture drive innovation and deliver meaningful and tailored outcomes for jobs, science and communities. To foster a culture where we celebrate and leverage diversity, we promote 1. Inclusive work groups we continually ensure that we capture diversity of ideas by including a broad selection of staff in decision making. 2. Connected networks we actively include, and co design solutions with, our state and region based staff and ensure our diversity network colleagues feel connected to their peers. 3. United vision we have a clear line of sight of how our work aligns to the team, branch, division and departmental priorities, thereby unifying our work and contribution to the departmental vision. 4. Workplace behaviours we ensure all staff have a clear understanding of the common expectations of respectful behaviours in the workplace. When we value workplace diversity and inclusion, we see benefits such as higher employee engagement, improved performance, greater innovation, retention of talent and improved employee wellbeing.

The review seeks to uncover some of the issues affecting managerial confidence and capability and develop a range of solutions to address the projects core challenge of How might we support managers confidence and capability when employing and managing team members with a lived experience of mental illness. The project has enjoyed significant support across government, including receiving over 16,000 survey responses, 4,500 free text comments, participation of 40 organisations in eco system mapping activities and hundreds of people registering to attend collaborative workshops on the topic across the country. The department has established a reference panel and we expect to table the final recommendations with the SEDC in September 2019. The project has the capacity to significantly impact the way mental health and wellbeing is managed across the APS. ICT capability Improving our ICT and digital capabilities We are seizing the opportunity for technology to be the catalyst for change to drive efficiencies, better connect people, drive use of data and information to deliver actionable insights and a strong evidence base, foster innovation and creativity and boost productivity. In line with the Government s priority to make the best use of digital technologies in driving greater efficiencies in whole of government service delivery, we are lifting our ICT capability and performance so that technology complements every aspect of what we do and what we deliver to businesses and citizens. Our plan is to leverage technology to transform the user experience n for businesses and customers, so that they can access faster, easier and more personalised information and services n for departmental staff, so that they more effectively and efficiently deliver policy and program objectives in a flexible, collaborative, inclusive and digitally enabled workspace. Our digital transformation requires us to build and prioritise capabilities. In the short term, we will continue to build our maturity in user centred design to ensure we provide technology solutions that best support our staff to make evidence based policy and program decisions. In the longer term, we will grow capability in artificial intelligence, data, cloud and cyber security, so that we can meet the department s future digital needs and keep pace with emerging technologies and trends. Lifting these capabilities will require significant investment over the next three years. To be more responsive to our customers needs, we will improve prioritisation of the delivery of customer products and solutions and refine our delivery approach, in line with the department s Financial Strategy. This will provide greater transparency and visibility of the work we do, measure customers outcomes, and enable us to dynamically reallocate resources to higher value activities and improve the management of ICT risks.
