27.12.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 371 1 I Acts whose publication is obligatory COMMISSION REGULATION EC No 1828 2006 of 8 December 2006 setting out rules for the implementation of Council Regulation EC No 1083 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and of Regulation EC No 1080 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation EC No 1083 2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund1, and in particular point d of Article 37 1 , the third paragraph of Article 44, Articles 59 6 , 60 b and 66 3 , point c of Article 67 2 , Articles 69 1 , 70 3 , 71 5 , 72 2 , 74 2 and 76 4 and the second subparagraph of Article 99 5 thereof, Having regard to Regulation EC No 1080 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the European Regional Development Fund2, and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 7 2 and the second paragraph of Article 13 thereof, Whereas 1 Regulation EC No 1083 2006 replaces Council Regulation EC No 1260 1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds3, and Regulation EC No 1080 2006 replaces Regulation EC No 1783 1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 1999 on the European Regional Development Fund4, both Regulations taking into account new developments in the field of Structural Funds. It is therefore appropriate also to lay down new provisions implementing Regulations EC No 1080 2006 and EC No 1083 2006. 1 OJ L 210, 31.7.2006, p. 25. 2 OJ L 210, 31.7.2006, p. 1. 3 OJL 161, 26.6.1999, p. 1. Regulation as last amended by Regulation EC No 173 2005 OJ L 29, 2.2. 2005, p.3 . 4 OJ L 213, 13.8.1999, p.1.  L 371 2 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.12.2006 2 Experience has shown that citizens of the European Union are insufficiently aware of the role played by the Community in funding programmes aimed at reinforcing economic competitiveness, creating jobs and strengthening internal cohesion. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the preparation of a communication plan which identifies in detail the information and publicity measures necessary to bridge this communication and information gap. For the same purpose, it is also necessary to identify the responsibilities and the roles that should be played by each of the actors involved. 3 In order to guarantee that information on possible funding opportunities is disseminated widely to all interested parties and for the sake of transparency, the minimum content of the information measures needed to inform potential beneficiaries about the financing opportunities offered jointly by the Community and the Member States through the Funds should be set out, including an obligation to publicise the steps that a potential beneficiary should take to submit an application for funding and the selection criteria that will be used. 4 In order to enhance transparency regarding use of the Funds, the list of beneficiaries, the names of the operations and the amount of public funding allocated to operations should be published, electronically or otherwise. 5 In order to ensure a better implementation of the information measures and to allow a better exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission on the information and publicity strategies and results, contact persons responsible for the information and publicity measures should be designated and should participate in appropriate Community networks. 6 For the purposes of Articles 37 and 67 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006, it is necessary to lay down detailed rules and categories to allow the Member States to submit to the Commission uniform information on the programmed use of the Funds, as well as information on the cumulative allocation of the Funds by categories throughout the life of a programme, and to enable the Commission to inform the other Institutions and the citizens of the European Union in an appropriate manner about the use of the Funds, including the achievement of the targets set out in Article 9 3 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006. 7 With regard to Article 60 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006 and in the light of the experience gained, it is necessary to lay down the obligations which the managing authorities should have with regard to beneficiaries in the phase leading to the selection and approval of the operations to be funded, with regard to the aspects which the verifications of the expenditure declared by the beneficiary should cover, including administrative verifications of the applications for reimbursement, and on the spot verifications of individual operations and with regard to the conditions to be observed when on the spot verifications are carried out on a sample basis. 8 It is also necessary to set out in detail the information which should be included in the accounting records of operations and the information to be kept as data on implementation which the managing authorities should record, store and send to the Commission upon request.  27.12.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 371 3 9 In order to ensure that expenditure under operational programmes can be properly audited, it is necessary to set out the criteria with which an audit trail should comply so as to be considered adequate. 10 The audit of operations is carried out under the responsibility of the audit authority. To ensure that the scope and effectiveness of those audits are adequate and that they are carried out according to the same standards in all Member States, it is necessary to set out the conditions which those audits should fulfil. 11 Experience has shown that it is necessary to set out in detail the basis for the sampling of operations to be audited, which the audit authority should observe in establishing or approving the sampling method, including certain technical criteria to be used for a random statistical sample and factors to be taken into account for a complementary sample. 12 In order to simplify and harmonise standards for the preparation and presentation of the audit strategy, the annual control report and the closure declarations for which the audit authority is responsible under Article 62 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006, it is necessary to make detailed provision about their content and specify the nature and quality of the information on which they rely. 13 In order to ensure the most effective application of Article 90 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006 with regard to the availability of documents and the right of the Court of Auditors and the Commission to have access to all supporting documents regarding expenditure and audits, managing authorities should ensure that information on the identity and location of the bodies holding the supporting documents is readily available and those documents should be readily supplied to a minimum list of persons and bodies. For the same purpose, it is necessary to set out which data carriers can be considered as commonly accepted for the purpose of keeping such documents. To this end, the national authorities should lay down the procedures necessary to ensure that the documents kept are in conformity with the originals, when this is relevant, and can be relied on for audit purposes. 14 In order to harmonise standards for the certification of expenditure and for the preparation of applications for payments, the content of such certificates and applications should be laid down and the nature and quality of the information on which they rely specified. Detailed procedures should be set out for keeping, in accordance with Article 61 f of Regulation EC No 1083 2006, an account of amounts recoverable and of amounts withdrawn following cancellation of all or part of the contribution for an operation and for informing the Commission accordingly. 15 Under Article 71 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006, the Member States are, before the submission of the first interim application for payment or at least within twelve months of the approval of each operational programme, to submit to the Commission a description of the management and control systems, a report setting out the results of an assessment of the systems set up and an opinion on their compliance with the provisions of that Regulation on management and control systems. Since those documents are among the principal elements on which the Commission relies, in the context of the shared management of the Community budget, to satisfy itself that the financial assistance concerned is used by the Member States in accordance with the applicable rules and principles necessary for protecting the Community s financial  L 371 4 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.12.2006 interests, it is necessary to set out in detail the information that such documents should contain and the basis for the assessment and the opinion. 16 Operational programmes funded under the European territorial cooperation objective referred to in Article 3 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006 are presented by two or more Member States and have specific features, which are laid down in Regulation EC No 1080 2006. It is therefore appropriate to set out the specific information which the description of the management and control system for those programmes should contain. 17 Article 74 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006 provides inter alia that for operational programmes for which the total eligible public expenditure does not exceed EUR 750 million and for which the level of Community co financing does not exceed 40 of the total public expenditure, a Member State may choose to rely more on national bodies and rules for carrying out certain functions related to the control and audit requirements. It is therefore necessary to set out which verifications, which audits of operations and which obligations can be carried out and executed according to national rules and by national bodies. 18 As part of their management and control obligations Member States are required to report and monitor irregularities. Detailed rules to implement that requirement were laid down in Commission Regulation EC No 1681 94 of 11 July 1994 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of the structural policies and the organisation of an information system in this field5, and Commission Regulation EC No 1831 94 of 26 July 1994 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of the Cohesion Fund and the organisation of an information system in this field6. It is appropriate, for reasons of clarity and simplification, to incorporate those rules into this Regulation. 19 Provision should be made for the Commission to reimburse judicial costs when it requests a Member State to initiate or continue legal proceedings with a view to recovering amounts unduly paid following an irregularity, and for it to be supplied with information enabling it to decide on the apportionment of the loss from irrecoverable amounts under Article 70 2 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006. Regular contact should also be provided for between the Commission and the Member States on the subject of irregularities, for the use of the information supplied for making risk analyses and compiling reports, and for the provision of information to the relevant committees. 20 In order to limit the administrative burden imposed by the reporting system while safeguarding the necessary level of information, Member States should, without prejudice to the obligations arising directly from Article 61 f of Regulation EC No 1083 2006, not be obliged to report irregularities involving amounts below a certain threshold unless the Commission expressly so requests. 5 OJ L 178, 12.7.1994, p. 43. Regulation as amended by Regulation EC No 2035 2005 OJ L 328, 15.12.2005,p. 8 6 OJ L 191, 27.7.1994, p. 9. Regulation as amended by Regulation EC No 2168 2005 OJ L 345, 28.12.2005, p.15 .  27.12.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 371 5 21 In the light of Directive 95 46 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data7 and Regulation EC No 45 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data8, it is necessary to provide, in relation to the information and publicity measures and the audit work under this Regulation, that the Commission and the Member States should prevent any unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data, and to specify the purpose for which the Commission and the Member States can process such data. 22 For reasons of legal certainty and of equal treatment of all Member States, it is necessary to fix the rate applicable to the financial correction which the Commission may make when a Member State does not comply with its obligation to maintain in all the regions concerned during the programming period an agreed target level of public or equivalent structural expenditure. For reasons of simplification and proportionality, no financial correction should be applied if the difference between the agreed target level and the level achieved is equal to or less than 3 of the agreed target level de minimis threshold for the same reasons, when the difference between the two levels is higher that 3 of the agreed target level, the rate should be calculated by subtracting that de minimis threshold. 23 The use of electronic means for the exchange of information and financial data leads to simplification, increased efficiency and transparency and to savings in time. In order to exploit these advantages fully, while preserving the security of exchanges, a common computer system should be established as well as a list of documents of common interest to the Commission and the Member States. It is therefore necessary to specify the format each document should have and to provide a detailed description of the information such documents should contain. For the same reasons, it is necessary to specify how such a computer system functions with regard to the identification of the party responsible for uploading the documents and any updates thereto. 24 In the framework of Directive 1999 93 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures9, taking account of the level of security and confidentiality required for the financial management of the use of the Funds, of the state of the art and of a cost benefit analysis, it is necessary to require the use of an electronic signature. 25 In order to ensure the quick development and proper functioning of the common computer system, the cost of its development should be financed by the budget of European Communities under Article 45 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006, and the costs of the interface with national, regional, and local computer systems should be eligible for a financial contribution from the Funds under Article 46 of the same Regulation. 7 OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31.Directive as amended by Regulation EC No 1882 2003 OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p.1 . 8 OJ L 8, 12.1.2001, p.1. 9 OJ L 13, 19.1.2000, p. 12.  L 371 6 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.12.2006 26 Building on the experience of the 2000 2006 programming period, it is necessary to set out in detail the conditions which financial engineering instruments should fulfil to be funded under an operational programme, it being understood that contributions to financial engineering instruments from the operational programme and other public sources, as well as the investments made by financial engineering instruments in individual enterprises, are subject to the rules on State aid including the Community Guidelines on State aid to promote risk capital investments in small and medium sized enterprises.10 27 It is necessary to adopt the list of criteria to be used for identifying the areas where expenditure on housing can be eligible for a contribution from the European Regional Development Fund under Article 7 2 of Regulation EC No 1080 2006 and the list of eligible interventions. Given the diversity of the situations prevailing in the Member States concerned, it is appropriate to establish a list of criteria for identifying the areas experiencing or threatened by physical deterioration and social exclusion where investment in housing may be eligible for co financing. It is also appropriate to set out that, in the case of multi family housing or housing designated for low income households or people with special needs, the interventions eligible for co financing should be those aimed at renovating the common parts of multi family residential buildings or at delivering modern social housing of good quality through investing in the renovation and change of use of existing buildings owned by public authorities or non profit operators. 28 Article 56 4 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006 provides that rules on the eligibility of expenditure are to be laid down at national level, subject to the exceptions provided in the specific regulations for each Fund. With regard to Article 13 of Regulation EC No 1080 2006, common rules on the eligibility of expenditure should be laid down which are applicable to operational programmes under the European territorial cooperation objective in order to ensure consistency between the rules applicable to projects implemented in different Member States. Building upon experience with similar programmes in the programming period 2000 2006, it is appropriate to lay down common rules for the categories of expenditure for which national rules are most likely to differ. In order to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries and programme authorities, flat rates for overheads should under certain conditions be eligible. 29 Regulations EC No 1681 94 and EC No 1831 94 as well as Commission Regulations EC No 1159 2000 of 30 May 2000 on information and publicity measures to be carried out by the Member States concerning assistance from the Structural Funds11, EC No 1685 2000 of 28 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation EC No 1260 1999 as regards eligibility of expenditure of operations co financed by the Structural Funds12, EC No 438 2001 of 2 March 2001 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation EC No 1260 1999 as regards the management and control systems for assistance granted under the Structural Funds13, EC No 448 2001 of 2 March 2001 10 OJ C 194, 18.8.2006, p. 2. 11 OJ L 130, 31.5.2000, p. 30. 12 OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 39.

Annex IV Technical parameters for random statistical sampling under Article 17 Sampling 1. A random statistical sampling method allows conclusions to be drawn from the results of audits of the sample on the overall expenditure from which the sample was taken, and hence provides evidence to obtain assurance on the functioning of the management and control systems. 2. The assurance provided on the functioning of the systems is determined by the degree of confidence resulting from the conclusions of the system audits and from the audits of operations in the sample selected by a random statistical sampling method. In order to obtain a high level of assurance, that is, a reduced audit risk, the audit authority should combine the results of system audits and audits of operations. The audit authority first evaluates the reliability of the systems high, average or low taking into account the results of systems audits, so as to determine the technical parameters of the sampling, in particular the confidence level and the expected error rate. Member States may also use the results of the report on the compliance assessment under Article 71 2 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006. The combined level of assurance obtained from the systems audits and the audits of operations should be high. The confidence level used for sampling operations should not be less than 60 with a maximum materiality level of 2 . For a system evaluated as having low reliability, the confidence level used for sampling operations should not be below 90 . The audit authority should describe in the annual control report the way assurance has been obtained. 3. The reliability of management and control systems is determined using criteria established by the audit authority for systems audits, including a quantified assessment of all key elements of the systems and encompassing the main authorities and intermediate bodies participating in the management and control of the operational programme. A record of the assessments carried out is kept in the audit file. 4. Where the management and control system is common to a number of similar operational programmes, for example for the same Fund, in accordance with Article 71 4 of Regulation EC No 1083 2006, a single sample guaranteeing the same technical parameters of confidence and materiality levels and taking into account the same expected rate of error, as indicated above, may be selected for all programmes together.  27.12.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 371 63 Annex V Model Audit Strategy under Article 62 1 c of Regulation EC No 1083 2006 1.

The results of the examination and any additional work I have performed are summarised in the attached final control report which also contains the information required by the annual control report for the period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016 . I have planned and performed this work with a view to obtaining a reasonable assurance as to whether the payment application for the final balance of the Community contribution to the operational programme is correct and valid and the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are legal and regular. 2. SCOPE OF THE EXAMINATION The examination was carried out in accordance with the audit strategy in respect of this programme and reported in the attached final control report under point e of Article 62 1 of Council Regulation EC No 1083 2006. Either There were no limitations on the scope of the examination. Or The scope of the examination was limited by the following factors a b c , etc. Indicate any limitation on the scope of the examination, for example any systemic problems, weaknesses in the management and control system, lack of supporting documentation, cases under legal proceedings, etc., and estimate the amounts of expenditure and the Community contribution affected. If the audit authority does not consider that the limitations have an impact on the final expenditure declared, this should be stated. 3. IRREGULARITIES AND ERROR RATES Either The cases of irregularity and error rates found in the audit work are not such as to preclude an unqualified opinion given the satisfactory way they have been dealt with by the managing authority and the trend in the level of their occurrence over time. Or  27.12.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 371 75 The cases of irregularity and error rates found in the audit work and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority are such as to preclude an unqualified opinion. A list of these cases is provided in the final control report, together with an indication of their possible systemic character and the scale of the problem. The amounts of total declared expenditure and public contribution that could be affected are... respectively. As a consequence, the corresponding Community contribution that could be affected is . 4. OPINION Either Unqualified opinion If there were no limitations on the scope of the examination and the cases of irregularity and error rates and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority do not preclude an unqualified opinion Based on the examination referred to above, it is my opinion that the final statement of expenditure presents fairly, in all material respects, the expenditure paid under the operational programme, that the application for payment of the final balance of the Community contribution to this programme is valid and that the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are legal and regular. Or Qualified opinion If there were limitations on the scope of the examination and or the cases of irregularity and error rates and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority call for a qualified opinion but do not justify an unfavourable opinion for all the expenditure concerned Based on the examination referred to above, it is my opinion that the final statement of expenditure presents fairly, in all material respects, the expenditure paid under the operational programme, that the application for payment of the final balance of the Community contribution to this programme is valid and that the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are legal and regular, except with regard to the matters referred to at point 2 and or to the observations at point 3 regarding the error rates and cases of irregularity and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority, the impact of which is quantified above. I estimate the impact of these qualifications to be of the total expenditure declared. The Community contribution affected is thus .. Or Adverse opinion If there were major limitations on the scope of the examination error rates and cases of irregularity and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority such that no conclusion can be reached on the reliability of the final statement of expenditure without considerable further work Based on the examination referred to above, and in particular in view of the matters referred to at point 2 and or the error rates and cases of irregularity and the fact that they have not been  L 371 76 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.12.2006 dealt with satisfactorily by the managing authority as reported at point 3, it is my opinion that the final statement of expenditure does not present fairly, in all material respects, the expenditure paid under the operational programme, that, as a consequence, the application for payment of the final balance of the Community contribution to this programme is not valid and that the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are not legal and regular.
