INTRODUCTION The Hague Programme, endorsed by the European Council on 4 5 November 2004, stressed the importance of having an open debate on economic immigration at EU level, which together with the best practices in Member States and their relevance for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy should be the basis for a policy plan on legal migration including admission procedures capable of responding promptly to fluctuating demands for migrant labour in the labour market1 , to be presented by the end of 2005. This document represents the Commission s response to this European Council s request. On 11 January 2005 the Commission adopted a Green Paper on an EU approach to managing economic migration2 to fulfil its political mandate and launch a process of in depth discussion on the most appropriate Community rules for admitting economic immigrants and on the added value of adopting such common measures. The response to the public consultation revealed a significant political interest in this matter3 The European Parliament, the European Social and Economic Committee and the Committee of the Regions have also adopted their respective opinions4. A public hearing was held on 14 June 2005. The analysis of the contributions showed a general support for a common EU policy for economic immigration, albeit with important differences in the approaches to be followed and in the expected end result. The issues raised and the suggestions put forward represent a good basis for the elaboration of this document. Building on the existing framework, this Policy Plan defines a road map for the remaining period of The Hague Programme 2006 2009 and lists the actions and legislative initiatives that the Commission intends to take, so as to pursue the coherent development of EU legal migration policy5. It also responds to the Commission s Lisbon programme adopted in July 2005. 1.1. The political context Over the past decades, worldwide migration flows have been growing considerably6. Economic differences between, and demographic changes within, developed and developing countries, on a background of trade, political problems and instability in countries of origin, have all contributed to a steady increase in workforce mobility. Given the evolving EU economic and social situation, the international context and the likely growth of immigration in the future, an agreement on common EU rules covering the broad spectrum of migration issues is necessary in order to ensure an efficient management of 1 European Council conclusions, Annex I, III 1.4 2 For details of all instruments referred to in this document, see bibliography 3 omic_migration_en.htm 4 EP A6 0286 2005 SOC 199 CESE 694 05 ECOS 045 5 Since 1999, 4 directives based on Art. 63 3 and 4 EC containing provisions on access to work long term residents, family reunification, students, researchers and several Communications have been adopted 6 ILO report 2004 World Bank report 2005 EU Economy 2005 review   EN 4 EN migration flows both toward and inside Europe, as confirmed by the October 2005 Communication on European values in the globalised world7. It must be noted that whilst decisions on admission numbers for economic immigrants entering the EU in order to seek work are the responsibility of the Member States, it is clear that the admission of third country nationals in one Member State may affect others and their labour markets. Moreover, the ongoing deliberations on future policies must also take into account the Community preference principle and duly consider discussions on the transitional measures presently affecting the freedom of movement of the citizens of the new Member States and their political and economic impact. An effective migration policy cannot be limited to instruments for the admission of immigrants. Other equally important legislative and operational measures are necessary, as immigration represents a complex phenomenon that needs to be addressed coherently across all its dimensions. Admission of economic immigrants is as inseparable from measures on integration on the one hand, as it is from the fight against illegal immigration and employment, including trafficking, on the other. It is in this context therefore that the EU must intensify its efforts to reduce the informal economy, a clear pull factor for illegal immigration, as well as a catalyst for exploitation. Given the importance of this issue, a separate Communication on future priorities in the field of illegal immigration will be issued by April 2006. This paper therefore puts forward initiatives to be developed in all these areas, including on cooperation with countries of origin. In the development of the various initiatives, due attention will be paid to gender issues, with a view to protecting the most vulnerable groups. 1.2. The Lisbon Agenda and demographic trends With regard to economic immigration, the current situation and prospects of EU labour markets can be broadly described as a need scenario. Some Member States already experience substantial labour and skills shortages in certain sectors of the economy, which cannot be filled within the national labour markets. This phenomenon concerns the full range of qualifications from unskilled workers to top academic professionals. Eurostat projections8 indicate that in the EU population growth until 2025 will be mainly due to net migration, since total deaths will outnumber total births from 2010. The effect of net migration will no longer outweigh the natural decrease after 2025 . This will have serious repercussions on the number of employed people in the EU25, as the share of population of working age in the total population is expected to decrease strongly, from 67.2 in 2004 to 56.7 in 2050, a fall of 52 million . The decline in the total population is expected by 2025 and in the working age population by 2011. Some Member States Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia are already experiencing a decline in the working age population, while in others it will happen later i.e. Ireland from 2035 . These demographic trends will not affect 7 COM 2005 525 8 The Eurostat set of population projections is one among several scenarios of population evolution based on assumptions of fertility, mortality and migration. The trend scenario does not take into account any future measures that could influence demographic trends and comprises four variants the baseline variant, the results of which are presented here, as well as high population , low population and zero migration variants. Data from STAT 05 48   EN 5 EN all Member States to the same degree, but they are trends that should be addressed in a coordinated and effective way. Immigration does not provide in itself a long term solution to falling birth rates and an ageing population, but it is one of the available tools within a broader policy mix. In consideration of the low employment and high unemployment rates in many EU countries9, priority must be given to actions toward attracting more EU citizens and legally resident migrants to employment, with the aim of fulfilling the objectives of the New Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, in particular the employment guidelines10. In the short to mid term, labour immigration can as part of Lisbon Strategy s comprehensive package of measures aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the EU economy positively contribute to tackling the effects of this demographic evolution, and will prove crucial to satisfying current and future labour market needs and thus ensure economic sustainability and growth. 2. LEGISLATIVE MEASURES ON LABOUR IMMIGRATION The public consultation which was undertaken confirmed the need to develop EU common rules in this field and it also provided the Commission with a useful basis on which to put forward balanced and realistic proposals. The public consultation drew the attention to possible advantages of a horizontal framework covering conditions of admission for all third country nationals seeking entry into the labour markets of the Member States. However, the Member States themselves did not show sufficient support for such an approach. Moreover, there is the need to provide for sufficient flexibility to meet the different needs of national labour markets. Therefore, it is deemed more appropriate to attain the objectives of transparency, effectiveness of EU legislation and non discrimination through a targeted set of several complementary measures a general framework directive and four specific instruments. This package aims thus to develop non bureaucratic and flexible tools to offer a fair, rights based approach to all labour immigrants on the one hand and attracting conditions for specific categories of immigrants needed in the EU, on the other. Unlike the 2001 proposal for a directive on economic migration which intended to regulate the entry and residence conditions for all third country nationals exercising paid and self employed activities this package only addresses the conditions and the procedures of admission for few selected categories of economic immigrants. In addition, it intends to establish which rights a third country national in employment shall enjoy once he she has been admitted to the territory of a Member State. These proposals will be preceded by discussions and consultations with the relevant experts. The economic impact on employment and growth will also be taken into account. This package is not exhaustive. If appropriate, additional proposals may be presented in areas where further examination is needed e.g. to address those situations where personal contacts between economic immigrants and future employers are a pre requisite for hiring, or to regulate the self employed, etc . 9 The EU25 seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 8.6 in September 2005 as in August ranging from 4.3 IE to 17.7 PL . It was 9.0 in September 2004 Eurostat 141 2005 10 Council Decision of 12 July 2005 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States   EN 6 EN 2.1. General framework directive With the exception of the single application for a joint permit, this instrument will not address admission conditions and procedures for economic immigrants, which will be laid down in the specific instruments. It will also not affect the application of the Community preference11 principle. The main purpose of this horizontal instrument is to guarantee a common framework of rights to all third country nationals in legal employment already admitted in a Member State, but not yet entitled to the long term residence status. This would not only be fair toward persons contributing with their work and tax payments to our economies, but would also contribute to establishing a level playing field within the EU. In this context, the question of recognition of diplomas and other qualifications should be addressed to avoid the situation where immigrants work well below their competences, a loss in terms of income and skills valorisation for the immigrant as well as for the countries of residence and origin. A single application for a joint work residence permit held by the worker and containing the most advanced biometric identifiers could be proposed. While not significantly affecting national internal procedures, it would simplify procedures for immigrants and employers. In order to limit abuses and to fight against illegal employment, the financial responsibility of the employer could be engaged, as in the researchers directive. The validity of such a document should be inextricably linked to the existence of a legal work contract exceptions to this principle could be foreseen under specific conditions of nationals labour markets, and will be addressed in the specific directives. 2.2. Four specific directives It was examined whether to propose specific schemes for precise sectors of the economy or for broad categories of immigrants. In the present situation and given the differences between Member States in terms of demographic forecasts, social conditions and labour market structures, trends and needs, it was not deemed economically and socially efficient to address any specific sector, as this could result in an unwanted stiffening of national labour markets. On the other hand, the public consultation clearly identified categories of workers for which common needs and interests exist. The intention is also to strike a balance between the interests of certain Member States more inclined to attract highly skilled workers and of those needing mainly seasonal workers. These instruments will be complementary to the framework directive and will only address paid workers. As a general principle, admission should be conditional on the existence of a work contract and on the economic needs test . Exceptions may be necessary for declared structural temporary needs in certain sectors occupations regions. International commitments entered into by the EC, or by the EC and its Member States, notably under the Common 11 Member States will consider requests for admission to their territories for the purpose of employment only where vacancies in a Member State cannot be filled by national and Community manpower or by non Community manpower lawfully resident on a permanent basis in that Member State and already forming part of the Member State s regular labour market Council Resolution of 20 June 1994, in connection with Council Regulation EEC n 1612 1968 . It should be noted that the Treaties of Accession of 16 April 2003 and 25 April 2005 give preference to workers who are nationals of the Members States over workers who are nationals of third countries as regards access to Member States labour markets   EN 7 EN Commercial Policy, will need to be respected. Moreover, ethical recruitment should be considered for sectors particularly vulnerable to brain drain for example, the global crisis in human resources for health, with severe health worker shortages in parts of Africa in particular, which are compounded by the brain drain, requires a comprehensive and coherent approach to ethical recruitment of health workers12. 2.2.1. A proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of highly skilled workers13 The vast majority of Member States need these workers, because of shortfalls in the labour markets pool of highly qualified workers. Furthermore, recent studies highlight for example that 54 of Med MENA first generation immigrants with a university degree reside in Canada and the USA, while 87 of those having a lower than primary, a primary or a secondary level education are in Europe14. In response to this situation a common special procedure to quickly select and admit such immigrants, as well as attractive conditions to encourage them to choose Europe could be devised. In this respect, it will be further evaluated whether to include intra EU mobility or to opt for a more ambitious proposal, i.e. an EU work permit EU green card , issued by one Member State but valid throughout the EU, on the understanding that rules regulating access to the national labour markets will be fully respected. Fluctuating demands for migrant labour15 can only be met by flexible facilitated procedures. The proposal could then provide for an opening clause, applicable when there is a need for certain categories of workers other than highly skilled i.e. qualified workers or a lack of manpower in certain regions. The only obligation would be to report through the mutual information system on immigration and asylum. 2.2.2. A proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of seasonal workers Seasonal workers are regularly needed in certain sectors, mainly agriculture, building and tourism, where many immigrants work illegally under precarious conditions. The scheme will propose a residence work permit allowing the third country national to work for a certain number of months per year for 4 5 years. Entry and exit stamps should prevent abuses. The aim is to provide the necessary manpower in the Member States while at the same time granting a secure legal status and a regular work prospective to the immigrants concerned, thereby protecting a particularly weak category of workers and also contributing to the development of the countries of origin16. Even in presence of high unemployment, this category of immigrant workers rarely conflict with EU workers as few EU citizens and residents are willing to engage in seasonal activities. 12 COM 2005 642 13 Other than researchers 14 CARIM 2005 Report p. 21 15 See note 1 16 COM 2005 390   EN 8 EN 2.2.3. A proposal for a directive on the procedures regulating the entry into, the temporary stay and residence of Intra Corporate Transferees ICT This scheme will set out common procedures to regulate the entry into, temporary stay and residence in the EU of ICT. These procedures will be without prejudice to international commitments entered into by the EC or by the EC and its Member States. In order to enable the reallocation of international companies key personnel and specialists within Europe, intra EU mobility of ICT should also be addressed, as it would be a clear added value of the EU intervention. 2.2.4. A proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of remunerated trainees This is a particular category of persons in training for which no common rules exist unlike for unremunerated trainees17 it is therefore important to fill in this legislative gap. Allowing third country nationals to acquire skills and knowledge through a period of training in Europe can be a way to encourage brain circulation, beneficial for both the sending and receiving country. Safeguards will be necessary to avoid abuses, i.e. trainees who are in reality underpaid temporary workers. 2.3. Other legislative measures All legal immigration and asylum directives contain provisions regulating access to work for the third country nationals concerned18. After evaluation, proposals for amendment could be put forward with a view to achieving further harmonisation, even before the mid term review foreseen in the respective texts. 3. KNOWLEDGE BUILDING AND INFORMATION Consulted stakeholders clearly stressed the added value of EU action to ensure a better access to, exchange and dissemination of information on various aspects of migration. They also acknowledged the importance of fostering policy debate and knowledge building. Hence, a number of tools will be developed in the next years, to achieve a substantial improvement in access, exchange and co ordination of available information. The list of actions presented is not exhaustive, complementary activities may be envisaged. 3.1. Information and policy debate An EU Immigration Portal containing EU policies and acquis, news and information, as well as links with the relevant national websites, the EURES network, the future EU integration website, relevant research results at EU and international level, etc will be set up by the end of 2007. Specific information campaigns on the EU policies on immigration will be carried out, together with further studies, in particular on job seekers permits and highly skilled systems. Targeted EU activities will support the debate and exchange of experiences among stakeholders. The 2006 European Year of Workers Mobility and the 2007 European Year of 17 Directive 2004 114 EC 18 Annex III   EN 9 EN Equal Opportunities for All will identify, discuss and address significant issues related to third country immigrants. Besides monitoring the implementation of the existing legal instruments, the Commission will support national and EU level awareness raising, information and training initiatives. 3.2. The European Job Mobility Portal EURES The consultation process highlighted that the services provided via the European Job Mobility Portal and the EURES19 network to foster mobility of EU nationals could also support the management of economic immigration of third country nationals. In this context, the forthcoming revision of the EURES Guidelines will provide a relevant framework to adapt and expand services made available via the portal, to respond to some of the information needs examined above e.g. provide regular information on employment opportunities in Europe, EU labour market trends, etc , optimising synergies with the future EU immigration portal and the European Researchers Mobility portal20. The new Guidelines 2007 2010 will provide a medium term horizon to implement the necessary adaptations. 3.3. The European Migration Network EMN EMN goal was to provide the EC, its Member States and in the longer term the general public, with objective, reliable and comparable information on migration and asylum21. The analysis of the results of the public consultation on the Green Paper on the future of the EMN22 will identify the future priorities, develop adequate structures and take the necessary steps to ensure the satisfactory delivery of results, in order to improve available information. A reflection on how to better streamline the various present and future EC networks and sources of information on migration will be carried out in this context. 4. INTEGRATION The 2003 Communication on Immigration, Integration and Employment stressed that access to the labour market is crucial for the integration of third country nationals. The 2005 Communication on a Common Agenda for Integration, which the Commission will actively follow up, put forward a framework for the integration of third country nationals in the EU. The orientations contained in this Communication have been supported by the Council in its conclusions on a common agenda for integration adopted in December 2005. As integration cuts across various fields, including employment, urban policies and education, the Commission will ensure joint efforts to coherently reflect integration priorities across a range of policies. Among measures recommended in various relevant areas23 are reinforcing of the capacity of introduction programmes and activities for legal immigrants and their dependants. They should include information packages for newly arrived economic immigrants, as well as language and civic orientation courses aimed at ensuring that 19 20 21 Laeken European Council 22 COM 2005 606 23 For details COM 2005 389   EN 10 EN immigrants understand, respect and benefit from common European and national values. Education, training and cultural initiatives will continue to support integration processes. The EU assists Member States integration policies via financial instruments, such as the Preparatory Actions for integration of third country nationals INTI. Under the financial perspectives 2007 2013, the Commission proposed a new targeted solidarity instrument, the European Fund for the Integration of third country nationals. Its objectives complementary to the European Social Fund ESF are related to challenges identified with respect to third country nationals, and are based on Common Basic Principles on Integration agreed by JHA Council in November 2004. A specific priority of the draft ESF regulation for 2007 2013 is to increase immigrants participation in employment and strengthen their social integration. In this respect, the Commission intends to give particular attention to ensure that effective action and adequate resources are devoted to this priority. The negotiation of the Strategic National Frameworks and corresponding operational programmes will be the institutional vehicle to ensure that in the coming years EU funds will be effectively used for this purpose. The European Regional Development Fund may also support certain integration measures. 5. COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN A clear outcome of the consultation was the need to enhance collaboration with third countries on economic migration and to develop initiatives offering win win opportunities to countries of origin and destination and to labour immigrants. One possible action is monitoring migration of skilled workers from developing countries to the EU so as to identify sectors and countries of origin subject to significant brain drain. Discussions within the EU and with these countries should take place to seek possible solutions. Furthermore, the Commission, mindful of the importance of providing more comprehensive information in the Countries of origin on the possibilities and conditions for legal immigration to the EU, intends to take the necessary steps to enlarge the sources of information presently available. Other initiatives could be put forward in the following areas and the EU may provide adequate financial support where possible. 5.1. Instruments to support circular and return migration The Communication on Migration and development highlighted the importance of facilitating return migration and circular migration. Its follow up also by specific measures can contribute significantly to the development of an EU economic migration policy. The Directive on the status of long term residents already offers interesting possibilities, such as the possibility for Member States to allow returning migrants to retain this status for longer than the one year period provided for in Art. 9. Feasibility studies are foreseen on possible new measures, i.e. long term multi entry visas for returning migrants or the possibility for former migrants to be given priority and obtain a new residence permit for further temporary employment in the former host country under a simplified procedure. In this respect, an EU database of third country nationals having left the EU at the expiration of their temporary residence work permit could be set up. A feasibility opportunity analysis of such database   EN 11 EN could for example be included in the impact assessment that should be carried out for the entry exit system24. Furthermore, the EU should actively pursue efforts to design temporary migration schemes that could help maximise benefits for all interested parties, i.e. responding to labour needs in Member States while contributing, through eventual return, to the development of countries of origin and offering skills and other gains to participating migrants. Arrangements on managed temporary and circular migration will be included in some of the specific instruments 2.2 . 5.2. Training in the countries of origin Irrespective of pre departure integration measures, professional training and linguistic courses in the country of origin could help immigrants to develop skills and better adjust to the labour needs in the EU, thus facilitating their opportunities to find legal employment. The political opportunity and the technical financial feasibility of supporting with EC funding the establishment of adequate training structures under the responsibility of the local authorities and or of non governmental actors will be closely explored. Whatever the actions taken, the admission of a worker should not be conditional on the attendance of such courses, even though facilitations could be envisaged. 6. CONCLUSION With this Policy Plan, the Commission fulfils the mandate of The Hague Programme and responds to the ideas and suggestions put forward during the public consultation. Precise measures will be proposed in the next four years and additional studies and analysis will be carried through see Annex I . Further discussions and consultations with experts from Member States, social partners and other relevant stakeholders will take place in due time. 24 COM 2005 597   EN 12 EN ANNEXES I.

Population growth in the EU25 until 2025 will be mainly due to net migration, since total deaths in the EU25 will outnumber total births from 2010. The effect of net migration will no longer outweigh the natural decrease after 2025, when the population will start to decline gradually. The population will reach 449.8 million on 1 January 2050, that is a decrease of more than 20 million inhabitants compared to 2025. Over the whole projection period the EU25 population will decrease by 1.5 , resulting from a 0.4 increase for the EU15 and a 11.7 decrease for the ten new Member States.

EN 26 EN Table 3 Net migration, including corrections in thousands Source Eurostat estimates Net migration is the difference between immigration into and emigration from the area during the year net migration is therefore negative when the number of emigrants exceeds the number of immigrants . Since most countries either do not have accurate figures on immigration and emigration or have no figures at all, net migration is estimated on the basis of the difference between population change and natural increase between two dates. The statistics on net migration are therefore affected by all the statistical inaccuracies in the two components of this equation, especially population change. The table above shows that most EU Member States are now immigration countries and that even those which are still emigration countries Latvia, Lithuania and Poland are in the path towards becoming immigration countries as well, as negative net migration is gradually evolving towards migratory balance. 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 EU 25 countries 1118.4 826.0 632.5 732.7658.0 468.5644.6 905.7 993.2 1311.5 1707.3 2091.5 EU 15 countries 1216.1 896.9 678.8 765.9684.2 482.8665.1 903.21055.61321.8 1701.2 2052.1 Euro zone 1139.9 763.0 533.2 608.6556.8 377.4429.3 716.1 852.6 1096.9 1534.2 1755.9 Belgium 25.7 18.3 17.3 1.8 15.1 9.8 11.6 16.7 12.9 35.7 40.5 35.6 Czech Republic 11.8 5.5 10.0 9.9 10.2 12.0 9.5 8.8 28.0 8.5 12.3 25.8 Denmark 11.6 11.4 10.5 28.6 17.5 12.1 11.0 9.4 10.1 12.0 9.6 7.0 Germany 776.3 462.4 315.6 398.3281.5 93.4 47.0 202.1 167.8 274.8 218.8 142.2 Estonia 41.5 28.3 20.9 15.6 13.4 6.9 6.7 1.1 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.0 Greece 94.5 86.5 78.1 77.3 70.9 61.5 54.8 45.1 29.3 37.8 38.0 35.8 Spain 54.2 59.2 54.7 60.4 73.5 83.6148.8 227.3 378.5 427.8 649.9 738.5 France 36.5 16.5 3.5 14.5 18.5 13.5 6.5 45.0 50.1 60.4 65.1 55.0 Ireland 1.7 3.4 3.0 6.0 15.9 17.4 16.2 24.3 31.5 38.8 32.7 31.3 Italy 27.8 24.2 25.7 31.5 59.5 55.7 64.1 46.4 55.2 47.6 349.3 600.6 Cyprus 10.7 8.7 7.0 6.6 6.0 5.5 4.2 4.2 4.0 4.6 6.9 12.4 Latvia 53.5 32.4 22.8 13.8 10.1 9.4 5.8 4.1 5.4 5.2 1.8 0.9 Lithuania 24.5 24.0 24.2 23.7 23.4 22.4 22.1 20.7 20.3 2.5 1.9 6.3 Luxembourg 4.1 3.9 3.8 4.3 3.5 3.6 3.8 4.4 3.5 3.3 2.6 2.1 Hungary 18.5 18.2 18.0 17.8 17.8 17.5 17.3 16.8 16.7 9.8 3.5 15.5 Malta 0.9 1.0 1.0 0.2 0.7 0.6 0.4 0.5 9.9 2.2 2.0 1.8 Netherlands 43.2 44.5 20.4 15.0 21.3 30.5 44.1 43.9 57.0 56.0 27.6 7.0 Austria 71.5 33.5 3.1 2.1 3.9 1.5 8.5 19.8 17.2 43.5 34.8 38.2 Poland 11.6 16.8 19.0 18.2 12.8 11.7 13.2 14.0 19.6 16.8 18.0 13.8 Portugal 4.5 8.4 17.3 22.3 26.2 29.4 32.3 38.0 47.1 64.9 70.1 63.5 Slovenia 5.5 4.5 0.0 0.8 3.5 1.4 5.5 10.9 2.7 4.9 2.2 3.6 Slovakia 2.9 1.7 4.7 2.9 2.2 1.8 1.3 1.5 22.4 1.1 0.9 1.4 Finland 9.1 9.1 3.7 4.2 4.0 4.8 4.5 3.4 2.4 6.1 5.2 5.8 Sweden 19.8 32.1 50.8 11.7 5.8 5.9 11.0 13.6 24.5 28.6 30.9 28.7 United Kingdom 44.8 90.2 84.2 117.0104.0 87.4213.8 164.2 168.5 184.3 126.4 260.5   EN 27 EN Table 4 Estimates of Annual Inflows of Work Permit Holders in 16 EU Countries Country All Work Permit Holders Professionals with Work Permits Total Employment 2002 Comments DK 1600 500 2741000 2003.

Amanda Levinson, Centre on Migration, Policy and Society, University of Oxford 2005. 3,703,845 persons have been regularised in these five EU countries since the early 1980s. This does not necessarily concern an equal number of irregular migrants, as the same person may have been subject to different regularisation procedures if after a period of time the person has fallen once again in irregularity . Other EU countries have also used regularisations in the past. Regularisation figures point to a fundamental dysfunction in the system for admission of migrants in many EU Member States Migrants enter irregularly to fill the gaps in the labour market because legal ways to do so are very limited and ineffective. Usually, irregular migrants work in the hidden economy, as evidenced by the latest Spanish regularisation campaign.   EN 29 EN These are estimates provided by non official EU sources. The Commission is aware that there is a need for comprehensive and reliable data in the field of immigration and asylum. In order to dispose of comparable and reliable data, and to foster information sharing and policy debate within the Member States of the EU in immigration and asylum issues, it has recently put forward in particular two proposals for legislation 1 Proposal for a Council Decision on the establishment of a mutual information procedure concerning Member States measures in the areas of asylum and immigration, COM 2005 480 final 2 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics on migration and international protection, COM 2005 375 final.
