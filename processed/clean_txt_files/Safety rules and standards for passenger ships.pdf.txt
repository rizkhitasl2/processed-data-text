I Acts adopted under the EC Treaty Euratom Treaty whose publication is obligatory DIRECTIVES DIRECTIVE 2009 45 EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 6 May 2009 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships Recast Text with EEA relevance THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80 2 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 , Having consulted the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty 2 , Whereas 1 Council Directive 98 18 EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships 3 has been substantially amended several times 4 . Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity. 2 Within the framework of the common transport policy measures must be adopted to enhance safety in maritime transport. 3 The Community is seriously concerned about shipping casualties in which passenger ships were involved resulting in a massive loss of life. Persons using passenger ships and high speed passenger craft throughout the Community have the right to expect and to rely on an appropriate level of safety on board. 4 Work equipment and personal protective equipment of workers are not covered by this Directive, because the provisions of Council Directive 89 391 EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work 5 and the relevant provisions of its relevant indi vidual directives are applicable to the use of such equipment on passenger ships engaged on domestic voyages. 5 The provision of maritime passenger transport services between Member States has already been liberalised by Council Regulation EEC No 4055 86 of 22 December 1986 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport between Member States and between Member States and third countries 6 . The application of the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States maritime cabotage has been provided for by Council Regulation EEC No 3577 92 7 .

Standards for vessels operating international voyages are being developed within the International Maritime Organi zation IMO . Procedures to request action at the IMO in order to bring the standards for international voyages into line with the standards of this Directive should be available. 7 In view, in particular, of the internal market dimension of maritime passenger transport, action at Community level is the only possible way to establish a common level of safety for ships throughout the Community. 8 In view of the principle of proportionality, a Directive is the appropriate legal instrument as it provides a framework for a uniform and compulsory application of the safety standards by Member States, while leaving to each Member State the right to decide the implemen tation tools that best fit its internal system. 9 In the interests of improving safety and avoiding distortions of competition the common safety requirements should apply to passenger ships and high speed passenger craft engaged on domestic voyages in the Community, irrespective of the flag they fly. It is, however, necessary to exclude some categories of ships for which the rules of this Directive are technically unsuitable or economically unviable. 10 Passenger ships should be divided into different classes depending upon the range and conditions of the sea areas in which they operate. High speed passenger craft should be categorised in accordance with the provisions of the High Speed Craft Code established by the IMO. 11 The main reference framework for the safety standards should be the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea the 1974 SOLAS Convention , as amended, which encompasses internationally agreed standards for passenger ships and high speed passenger craft engaged on international voyages, as well as appro priate Resolutions adopted by the IMO and other measures complementing and interpreting that Convention. 12 The various classes of both new and existing passenger ships require a different approach for establishing safety requirements guaranteeing an equivalent safety level in view of the specific needs and limitations of those various classes. It is appropriate to make distinctions in the safety requirements to be respected as between new and existing ships since imposing the rules for new ships on existing ships would involve such extensive structural changes as to make them economically unviable. 13 The financial and technical implications arising from the upgrading of existing ships to the standards provided for by this Directive justify certain transitional periods. 14 In view of the substantial differences in the design, construction and use of high speed passenger craft compared to traditional passenger ships, such craft should be required to respect special rules. 15 Shipborne marine equipment, complying with the provisions of Council Directive 96 98 EC of 20 December 1996 on marine equipment 1 , when installed on board a passenger ship, should not be subject to additional tests since such equipment is already subject to the standards and procedures of that Directive. 16 Directive 2003 25 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 April 2003 on specific stability requirements for ro ro passenger ships 2 introduced strengthened stability requirements for ro ro passenger vessels operating on international services to and from Community ports, and this enhanced measure should also apply to certain categories of such vessels operating on domestic services under the same sea conditions. Failure to apply such stability requirements should be grounds for phasing out ro ro passenger ships after a certain number of years of operation. In view of the structural modifications that the existing ro ro passenger ships may need to undergo in order to comply with the specific stability requirements, those requirements should be introduced over a period of years in order to give the part of the industry affected sufficient time to comply to that end, provision should be made for a phasing in timetable for existing ships. This phasing in timetable should not affect the enforce ment of the specific stability requirements in the sea areas covered by the Annexes to the Stockholm Agreement of 28 February 1996. 17 It is important to apply appropriate measures to ensure access in safe conditions for persons with reduced mobility to passenger ships and high speed passenger craft operating on domestic services in the Member States. 18 Subject to control under the Committee procedure, Member States may adopt additional safety requirements if justified by local circumstances, permit the use of equivalent standards, or adopt exemptions from the provisions of this Directive under certain operating conditions, or adopt safeguard measures in exceptional dangerous circumstances. EN L 163 2 Official Journal of the European Union 25.6.2009 1 OJ L 46, 17.2.1997, p. 25. 2 OJ L 123, 17.5.2003, p. 22.   19 Regulation EC No 2099 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 establishing a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships COSS 1 centralised the tasks of the committees established under the pertinent Community legislation on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and the protection of shipboard living and working conditions. 20 The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999 468 EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission 2 . 21 In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adapt certain provisions of this Directive, including its Annexes, to take account of developments at inter national level and specifically amendments to Inter national Conventions. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non essential elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999 468 EC. 22 In order to monitor the effective implementation and enforcement of this Directive, surveys should be carried out on new and existing passenger ships and craft. Compliance with this Directive should be certified by or on behalf of the Administration of the flag State. 23 In order to ensure full application of this Directive, Member States should lay down a system of penalties for breach of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and should monitor compliance with the provisions of this Directive on the basis of provisions modelled on those laid down in Council Directive 95 21 EC of 19 June 1995 on port State control of shipping 3 . 24 The new elements introduced into this Directive only concern the committee procedures. They therefore do not need to be transposed by the Member States. 25 This Directive should be without prejudice to the obli gations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex IV, Part B, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE Article 1 Purpose The purpose of this Directive is to introduce a uniform level of safety of life and property on new and existing passenger ships and high speed passenger craft, when both categories of ships and craft are engaged on domestic voyages, and to lay down procedures for negotiation at international level with a view to a harmonisation of the rules for passenger ships engaged on international voyages.

New class B, C and D ships having a length of less than 24 metres have to comply with the requirements of Regulations II 1 B 2 to II 1 B 8 and II 1 B 10 set out in this Annex, unless the Administration of a flag State whose flag such ships are entitled to fly ensures that they comply with the flag State s national rules and that such rules guarantee an equivalent level of safety. Where regulations of this Annex do not apply to new ships of less than 24 metres in length, the Administration of the flag State shall ensure that an equivalent safety level for such ships is provided through compliance with national rules. Existing class C and D ships do not have to comply with the regulations of Chapters II 1 and II 2 of this Annex, provided that the Administration of a flag State whose flag such ships are entitled to fly ensures that they comply with the flag State s national rules and that such rules guarantee an equivalent level of safety. Wherever the application of an IMO resolution is required in this Annex for existing ships, ships constructed until two years after the date of adoption by IMO of such resolution need not comply with such resolution provided they comply with the applicable previous resolution s , if any. Under repairs, alterations and modifications of a major character is understood, by way of example any change that substantially alters the dimensions of a ship, example lengthening by adding new midbody, any change that substantially alters the passenger carrying capacity of a ship, example vehicle deck converted to passenger accommodation, any change that substantially increases a ship s service life, example renewal of passenger accommodation on one entire deck. The indication R that follows several titles of regulations in this Annex refers to the regulations of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, as amended, on which the regulations set out in this Annex have been based.

PART B INTACT STABILITY, SUBDIVISION AND DAMAGE STABILITY 1 Intact stability Resolution A.749 18 NEW CLASS A, B, C AND D SHIPS OF 24 METRES IN LENGTH AND ABOVE All classes of new ships of 24 metres in length and above shall comply with the relevant provisions for passenger ships of the Code on Intact Stability as adopted on 4 November 1993 by the IMO at the 18th session of its Assembly through Resolution A.749 18 . EN L 163 18 Official Journal of the European Union 25.6.2009  Where Member States consider the application of the Severe Wind and Rolling Criterion of IMO Resolution A.749 18 inappropriate, an alternative approach ensuring satisfactory stability may be applied. This should be supported by evidence to the Commission which confirms that an equivalent level of safety is achieved. EXISTING CLASS A AND B SHIPS OF 24 METRES IN LENGTH AND ABOVE All existing class A and B ships shall, in all loading conditions, satisfy the following stability criteria after due correction for the effect of free surface of liquids in tanks in accordance with the assumptions of paragraph 3.3 of IMO Resolution A.749 18 , or equivalent. a The area under the curve of righting lever GZ curve shall not be less than i 0,055 metre radians up to an angle of heel of 30 ii 0,09 metre radians up to an angle of heel of either 40 or the angle of flooding, i.e. the angle of heel at which the lower edges of any openings in the hull, superstructures or deckhouses, being openings that cannot be closed weathertight, are immersed, if that angle be less than 40 iii 0,03 metre radians between the angles of heel of 30 and 40 or between 30 and the angle of flooding if this angle is less than 40 b The righting lever GZ shall be at least 0,20 metres at an angle of heel equal to or greater than 30 . c The maximum righting lever GZ shall occur at an angle of heel preferably exceeding 30 but not less than 25 . d The initial transverse metacentric height shall not be less than 0,15 metres. The loading conditions to be considered in order to verify the compliance with the above stability criteria shall include at least those listed in paragraph 3.5.1.1 of IMO Resolution A.749 18 . All existing ships of classes A and B having a length of 24 metres and over shall also comply with the additional criteria as given in IMO Resolution A.749 18 , paragraph 3.1.2.6 additional criteria for passenger ships and paragraph 3.2 Severe Wind and Rolling Criterion . Where Member States consider the application of the Severe Wind and Rolling Criterion of A.749 18 inappro priate, an alternative approach to ensuring satisfactory stability may be applied. This should be supported by evidence to the Commission which confirms that an equivalent level of safety is achieved. 2 Watertight subdivision NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS Every ship shall be subdivided by bulkheads, which shall be watertight up to the bulkhead deck, into watertight compartments the maximum length of which shall be calculated according to the specific requirements given below. Instead of those requirements, the regulations on subdivision and stability of passenger ships as an equivalent to Part B of Chapter II of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, as given in IMO Resolution A.265 VIII may be used, if applied in their entirety. Every other portion of the internal structure which affects the efficiency of the subdivision of the ship shall be watertight. 3 Floodable length R 4 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .1 The floodable length at a given point is the maximum portion of the length of the ship, having its centre at the point in question, which can be flooded, under the assumption for permeability given below, without the ship being submerged beyond the margin line. .2 In the case of a ship not having a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at any point may be determined to an assumed continuous margin line which at no point is less than 76 mm below the top of the deck at side to which the bulkheads concerned and the shell are carried watertight. EN 25.6.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 163 19  .3 Where a portion of an assumed margin line is appreciably below the deck to which bulkheads are carried, the Administration of the flag State may permit a limited relaxation in the watertightness of those portions of the bulkheads which are above the margin line and immediately under the higher deck. 4 Permissible length of compartments R 6 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS The maximum permissible length of a compartment having its centre at any point in the ship s length is obtained from the floodable length by multiplying the latter by an appropriate factor called factor of subdivision. 5 Permeability R 5 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS The definite assumptions referred to in Regulation 3 relate to the permeability of the spaces below the margin line. In determining the floodable length, the assumed average permeability of the spaces below the margin line shall be as indicated in the table in Regulation 8.3. 6 Subdivision factor The factor of subdivision shall be FOR NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS AND EXISTING CLASS B RO RO PASSENGER SHIPS 1,0 when the number of persons the ship is certified to carry is less than 400, and 0,5 when the number of persons the ship is certified to carry is 400 or more. Existing class B ro ro passenger ships have to comply with this requirement not later than the date of compliance laid down in Regulation II 1 B 8 2, paragraph 2. FOR EXISTING CLASS B NON RO RO PASSENGER SHIPS 1,0 7 Special requirements concerning ship subdivision R 7 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .1 Where in a portion or portions of a ship the watertight bulkheads are carried to a higher deck than in the remainder of the ship and it is desired to take advantage of this higher extension of the bulkheads in calculating the floodable length, separate margin lines may be used for each such portion of the ship provided that .1 the sides of the ship are extended throughout the ship s length to the deck corresponding to the upper margin line and all openings in the shell plating below this deck throughout the length of the ship are treated as being below a margin line, for the purpose of Regulation 15 and .2 the two compartments adjacent to the step in the bulkhead deck are each within the permissible length corresponding to their respective margin lines, and, in addition, their combined length does not exceed twice the permissible length based on the lower margin line. .2 A compartment may exceed the permissible length determined by the rules of Regulation 4 provided the combined length of each pair of adjacent compartments to which the compartment in question is common does not exceed either the floodable length or twice the permissible length, whichever is less. .3 A main transverse bulkhead may be recessed provided that all parts of the recess lie inboard of vertical surfaces on both sides of the ship, situated at a distance from the shell plating equal to one fifth of the breadth of the ship, and measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line. Any part of a recess which lies outside these limits shall be dealt with as a step in accordance with paragraph .6. .4 Where a main transverse bulkhead is recessed or stepped, an equivalent plane bulkhead shall be used in determining the subdivision. EN L 163 20 Official Journal of the European Union 25.6.2009  .5 Where a main transverse watertight compartment contains local subdivision and the Administration of the flag State is satisfied that, after any assumed side damage extending over a length of 3,0 metres plus 3 of the length of the ship or 11,0 metres, or 10 of the length of the ship whichever is the less, the whole volume of the main compartment will not be flooded, a proportionate allowance may be made in the permissible length otherwise required for such compartment. In such a case the volume of the effective buoyancy assumed on the undamaged side shall not be greater than that assumed on the damaged side. Allowance under this paragraph will only be made if such allowance is not likely to prevent compliance with Regulation 8. NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS .6 A main transverse bulkhead may be stepped provided that it meets one of the following conditions .1 the combined length of the two compartments, separated by the bulkhead in question, does not exceed either 90 of the floodable length or twice the permissible length, except that, in ships having a subdi vision factor equal to 1, the combined length of the two compartments in question shall not exceed the permissible length .2 additional subdivision is provided in way of the step to maintain the same level of safety as that secured by a plane bulkhead .3 the compartment over which the step extends does not exceed the permissible length corresponding to a margin line taken 76 mm below the step. .7 In ships of 100 metres in length and upwards, one of the main transverse bulkheads abaft the forepeak shall be fitted at a distance from the forward perpendicular which is not greater than the permissible length. .8 If the distance between two adjacent main transverse bulkheads, or their equivalent plank bulkheads, or the distance between the transverse planes passing through the nearest stepped portions of the bulkheads, is less than 3,0 metres plus 3 of the length of the ship, or 11,0 metres, or 10 of the length of the ship, whichever is less, only one of these bulkheads shall be regarded as forming part of the subdivision of the ship. .9 Where the required subdivision factor is 0,50, the combined length of any two adjacent compartments shall not exceed the floodable length. 8 Stability in damaged conditions R 8 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .1.1 Sufficient intact stability shall be provided in all service conditions so as to enable the ship to withstand the final stage of flooding of any one main compartment which is required to be within the floodable length. .1.2 Where two adjacent main compartments are separated by a bulkhead which is stepped under the conditions of Regulation 7.6.1, the intact stability shall be adequate to withstand the flooding of those two adjacent compartments. .1.3 Where the required factor of subdivision is 0,50, the intact stability shall be adequate to withstand the flooding of any two adjacent compartments. .2.1 The requirements of subparagraph .1 shall be determined by calculations which are in accordance with paragraphs .3, .4 and .6 and which take into consideration the proportions and design characteristics of the ship and the arrangement and configuration of the damaged compartments. In making these calculations the ship is to be assumed in the worst anticipated service condition as regards stability. .2.2 Where it is proposed to fit decks, inner skins or longitudinal bulkheads of sufficient tightness to seriously restrict the flow of water, proper consideration is to be given to such restrictions in the calculations.

This range may be reduced to a minimum of 10 in cases where the area under the righting lever curve is that specified in subparagraph .2.3.2 multiplied by the ratio 15 range, where range is expressed in degrees. .2.3.2 The area under the righting lever curve shall be at least 0,015 m rad, measured from the angle of equilibrium to the lesser of .1 the angle at which progressive flooding occurs .2 22 measured from upright in the case of one compartment flooding, or 27 measured from the upright in the case of the simultaneous flooding of two adjacent compartments. .2.3.3 A residual righting lever is to be obtained within the range of positive stability, taking into account the greatest of the following heeling moments .1 the crowding of all passengers towards one side .2 the launching of all fully loaded davit launched survival craft on one side .3 due to wind pressure as calculated by the formula GZðmetresÞ ¼ heeling moment displacment þ 0 04 However, in no case is the righting lever to be less than 0,10 metres. .2.3.4 For the purpose of calculating the heeling moments in paragraph .2.3.3 the following assumptions shall be made .1 Moment due to crowding of passengers .1.1 four persons per square metre .1.2 a mass of 75 kg for each passenger .1.3 passengers shall be distributed on available deck areas towards one side of the ship on the decks where assembly stations are located and in such a way that they produce the most adverse heeling moment. .2 Moment due to launching of all fully loaded davit launched survival craft on one side .2.1 all lifeboats and rescue boats fitted on the side to which the ship has heeled after having sustained damage shall be assumed to be swung out fully loaded and ready for lowering .2.2 for lifeboats which are arranged to be launched fully loaded from the stowed position, the maximum heeling moment during launching shall be taken EN L 163 22 Official Journal of the European Union 25.6.2009  .2.3 a fully loaded davit launched life raft attached to each davit on the side to which the ship has heeled after having sustained damage shall be assumed to be swung out ready for lowering .2.4 persons not in the life saving appliances which are swung out shall not provide either additional heeling or righting moment .2.5 life saving appliances on the side of the ship opposite to the side to which the ship has heeled shall be assumed to be in a stowed position. .3 Moments due to wind pressure .3.1 class B a wind pressure of 120 N m 2 to be applied classes C and D a wind pressure of 80 N m 2 to be applied .3.2 the area applicable shall be the projected lateral area of the ship above the waterline corresponding to the intact condition .3.3 the moment arm shall be the vertical distance from a point at one half of the mean draught corresponding to the intact condition to the centre of gravity of the lateral area. .2.4 When major progressive flooding occurs, that is, when it causes a rapid reduction in the righting lever of 0,04 metres or more, the righting lever curve is to be considered as terminated at the angle the progressive flooding occurs and the range and the area referred to in .2.3.1 and .2.3.2 should be measured to that angle. .2.5 In cases where the progressive flooding is of limited nature that does not continue unabated and causes an acceptably slow reduction in righting lever of less than 0,04 metres, the remainder of the curve shall be partially truncated by assuming that the progressively flooded space is so flooded from the beginning. .2.6 In intermediate stages of flooding, the maximum righting lever shall be at least 0,05 metres and the range of positive righting levers shall be at least 7. In all cases, only one breach in the hull and only one free surface need be assumed. NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .3 For the purpose of making damaged stability calculations the volume and surface permeabilities shall be as follows Spaces Permeability Appropriated to cargo or stores 60 Occupied by accommodations 95 Occupied by machineries 85 Intended for liquids 0 or 95 Whichever results in more severe requirements. Higher surface permeabilities are to be assumed in respect of spaces which, in the vicinity of the damaged waterplane, contain no substantial quantity of accommodation or machinery and spaces which are not generally occupied by any substantial quantity of cargo or stores. .4 Assumed extent of damage shall be as follows .1 longitudinal extent 3,0 metres plus 3 of the length of the ship, or 11,0 metres or 10 of the length of the ship, whichever is less .2 transverse extent measured inboard from the ship s side, at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line a distance of one fifth of the breadth of the ship and EN 25.6.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 163 23  .3 vertical extent from the base line upwards without limit .4 if any damage of lesser extent than that indicated in .4.1, .4.2 or .4.3 would result in a more severe condition regarding heel or loss of metacentric height, such damage shall be assumed in the calculations. .5 Unsymmetrical flooding is to be kept to a minimum consistent with efficient arrangements. Where it is necessary to correct large angles of heel, the means adopted shall, where practicable, be self acting, but in any case where controls to cross flooding fittings are provided they shall be operable from above the bulkhead deck. For new class B, C and D ships the maximum angle of heel after flooding but before equalisation shall not exceed 15 . Where cross flooding fittings are required the time for equalisation shall not exceed 15 minutes. Suitable information concerning the use of cross flooding fittings shall be supplied to the master of the ship. .6 The final conditions of the ship after damage and, in the case of unsymmetrical flooding, after equalisation measures have been taken shall be as follows .1 in the case of symmetrical flooding there shall be a positive residual metacentric height of at least 50 mm as calculated by the constant displacement method .2a unless provided otherwise in paragraph .6.2b, in the case of unsymmetrical flooding the angle of heel for one compartment flooding shall not exceed 7 for class B ships new and existing and 12 for classes C and D ships new . For the simultaneous flooding of two adjacent compartments, a heel of 12 may be permitted for existing and new class B ships, provided that the factor of subdivision is nowhere greater than 0,50 in that part of the ship that is flooded .2b for existing class B non ro ro passenger ships, constructed before 29 April 1990, in the case of unsymmetrical flooding, the angle shall not exceed 7 , except that in exceptional cases the Adminis tration may allow additional heel due to the unsymmetrical moment, but in no case shall the final heel exceed 15 .3 in no case shall the margin line be submerged in the final stage of flooding. If it is considered that the margin line may become submerged during an intermediate stage of flooding, the Administration of the flag State may require such investigations and arrangements as it considers necessary for the safety of the ship. .7 The master of the ship shall be supplied with the data necessary to maintain sufficient intact stability under service conditions to enable the ship to withstand the critical damage. In the case of ships requiring cross flooding, the master of the ship shall be informed of the conditions of stability on which the calculations of heel are based and shall be warned that excessive heeling might result should the ship sustain damage when in a less favourable condition. .8 The data referred to in paragraph .7 to enable the master to maintain sufficient intact stability shall include information which indicates the maximum permissible height of the ship s centre of gravity above keel KG , or alternatively the minimum permissible metacentric height GM , for a range of draughts or displacements sufficient to include all service conditions. The information shall show the influence of various trims taking into account the operational limits. .9 Each ship shall have scales of draughts marked clearly at the bow and stern. In the case where the draught marks are not located where they are easily readable, or operational constraints for a particular trade make it difficult to read the draught marks, then the ship shall also be fitted with a reliable draught indicating system by which the bow and stern draughts can be determined. .10 On completion of loading of the ship and prior to its departure, the master shall determine the ship s trim and stability and also ascertain and record that the ship is in compliance with stability criteria in the relevant regulations. The determination of the ship s stability shall always be made by calculation. An electronic loading and stability computer or equivalent means may be used for this purpose. .11 No relaxation from the requirements for damage stability may be considered by the Administration of the flag State unless it is shown that the intact metacentric height in any service condition necessary to meet these requirements is excessive for the service intended. EN L 163 24 Official Journal of the European Union 25.6.2009  .12 Relaxations from the requirements for damage stability shall be permitted only in exceptional cases and subject to the condition that the Administration of the flag State is to be satisfied that the proportions, arrangements and other characteristics of the ship are the most favourable to stability after damage which can practically and reasonably be adopted in the particular circumstances. 8 1 Stability of ro ro passenger ships in damaged conditions R 8 1 EXISTING CLASS B RO RO PASSENGER SHIPS .1 Existing class B ro ro passenger ships shall comply with Regulation 8 not later than the date of the first periodical survey after the date of compliance prescribed below, according to the value of A Amax as defined in the Annex of the Calculation Procedure to Assess the Survivability Characteristics of Existing Ro Ro Passenger Ships when Using a Simplified Method Based Upon Resolution A.265 VIII , developed by the Maritime Safety Committee at its 59th session in June 1991 MSC Circ. 574 Value of A Amax Date of compliance less than 85 1 October 1998 85 or more but less than 90 1 October 2000 90 or more but less than 95 1 October 2002 95 or more but less than 97,5 1 October 2004 97,5 or more 1 October 2005 8 2 Special requirements for ro ro passenger ships carrying 400 persons or more R 8 2 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B RO RO PASSENGER SHIPS Notwithstanding the provisions of Regulation II 1 B 8 and II 1 B 8 1 .1 new ro ro passenger ships certified to carry 400 persons or more shall comply with the provisions of paragraph .2.3 of Regulation II 1 B 8, assuming the damage applied anywhere within the ship s length L and .2 existing ro ro passenger ships certified to carry 400 persons or more shall comply with the requirements of paragraph .1 not later than the date of the first periodical survey after the date of compliance prescribed in subparagraph .2.1, .2.2 or .2.3 which occurs the latest .2.1 Value of A Amax Date of compliance less than 85 1 October 1998 85 or more but less than 90 1 October 2000 90 or more but less than 95 1 October 2002 95 or more but less than 97,5 1 October 2004 97,5 or more 1 October 2010 .2.2 Number of persons permitted to be carried 1 500 or more 1 October 2002 1 000 or more but less than 1 500 1 October 2006 600 or more but less than 1 000 1 October 2008 400 or more but less than 600 1 October 2010 EN 25.6.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 163 25  .2.3 Age of the ship equal or greater than 20 years where the age of the ship means the time counted from the date on which the keel was laid or the date on which it was at a similar stage of construction or from the date on which the ship was converted to a ro ro passenger ship. 8 3 Special requirements for passenger ships, other than ro ro passenger ships, carrying 400 persons or more CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS CONSTRUCTED ON OR AFTER 1 JANUARY 2003, OTHER THAN RO RO PASSENGER SHIPS. Notwithstanding the provisions of Regulation II 1 B 8 passenger ships, other than ro ro passenger ships, certified to carry more than 400 persons shall comply with the provisions of paragraphs 2.3 and 2.6 of Regulation II 1 B 8, assuming the damage applied anywhere within the ship s length L. 9 Peak and machinery space bulkheads R 10 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .1 A forepeak or collision bulkhead shall be fitted which shall be watertight up to the bulkhead deck. This bulkhead shall be located at a distance from the forward perpendicular of not less than 5 of the length of the ship and not more than 3 metres plus 5 of the length of the ship. .2 Where any part of the ship below the waterline extends forward of the forward perpendicular, e. g. a bulbous bow, the distances stipulated in paragraph .1 shall be measured from a point either .1 at the mid length of such extension or .2 at a distance 1,5 of the length of the ship forward of the forward perpendicular or .3 at a distance 3 metres forward of the forward perpendicular, whichever gives the smallest measurement. .3 Where a long forward superstructure is fitted, the forepeak or collision bulkhead shall be extended weathertight to the next full deck above the bulkhead deck. The extension shall be so arranged as to preclude the possibility of the bow door causing damage to it in the case of damage to, or detachment of, a bow door. .4 The extension required in paragraph .3 need not be fitted directly above the bulkhead below provided all parts of the extension are not located forward of the forward limit specified in paragraph .1 or in paragraph .2. However, in existing class B ships .1 where a sloping loading ramp forms part of the extension of the collision bulkhead above the bulkhead deck, the part of the ramp which is more than 2,3 metres above the bulkhead deck may extend no more than 1,0 metre forward of the forward limits specified in paragraphs .1 and .2 .2 where the existing ramp does not comply with the requirements for acceptance as an extension to the collision bulkhead and the position of the ramp prevents the siting of such extension within the limits specified in paragraph .1 or paragraph .2, the extension may be sited within a limited distance aft of the aft limit specified in paragraph .1 or paragraph .2. The limited distance aft should be no more than is necessary to ensure non interference with the ramp. The extension to the collision bulkhead shall open forward and comply with the requirements of paragraph .3 and shall be so arranged as to preclude the possibility of the ramp causing damage to it in the case of damage to, or detachment of, the ramp. .5 Ramps not meeting the above requirements shall be disregarded as an extension to the collision bulkhead. .6 In existing class B ships, the requirements of paragraph .3 and .4 apply as from the date of the first periodical survey after 1 July 1998. EN L 163 26 Official Journal of the European Union 25.6.2009  .7 An afterpeak bulkhead, and bulkheads dividing the machinery space, from the cargo and passenger spaces forward and aft, shall also be fitted and made watertight up to the bulkhead deck. The afterpeak bulkhead may, however, be stepped below the bulkhead deck, provided the degree of safety of the ship as regards subdivision is not thereby diminished. .8 In all cases stern tubes shall be enclosed in watertight spaces. The stern gland shall be situated in a watertight shaft tunnel or other watertight space separate from the stern tube compartment and of such volume that, if flooded by leakage through the stern gland, the margin line will not be submerged. 10 Double bottoms R 12 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS, AND NEW SHIPS CONSTRUCTED ON OR AFTER 1 JANUARY 2003 WITH A LENGTH OF 24 METRES AND ABOVE. .1 In new class B, C and D and existing class B ships, and new ships constructed on or after 1 January 2003 with a length of 24 metres and above, a double bottom shall be fitted extending from the forepeak bulkhead to the afterpeak bulkhead as far as this is practicable and compatible with the design and proper working of the ship. .1 In ships of 50 metres and upwards but less than 61 metres in length, a double bottom shall be fitted at least from the machinery space to the forepeak bulkhead, or as near thereto as practicable. .2 In ships of 61 metres and upwards but less than 76 metres in length, a double bottom shall be fitted at least outside the machinery space and shall extend to the fore and after peak bulkheads or as near thereto as practicable. .3 In ships of 76 metres in length and upwards, a double bottom shall be fitted amidships and shall extend to the fore and after peak bulkhead or as near as practicable. .2 Where a double bottom is required to be fitted its depth shall comply with the standards of a recognised organisation and the inner bottom shall be continued out to the ship s sides in such a manner as to protect the bottom to the turn of the bilge. Such protection will be deemed satisfactory if the line of intersection of the outer edge of the margin plate with the bilge plating is not lower at any part than a horizontal plane passing through the point of intersection with the frame line amidships of a transverse diagonal line inclined at 25 to the base line and cutting it at a point one half of the ship s moulded breadth from the middle line. .3 Small wells constructed in the double bottom in connection with drainage arrangements of holds, etc., shall not extend downwards more than necessary. The depth of the well shall in no case be more than the depth less 460 mm of the double bottom at the centreline, nor shall the well extend below the horizontal plane referred to in paragraph .2. A well extending to the outer bottom is, however, permitted at the after end of the shaft tunnel. Other wells e.g. for lubricating oil under main engines may be permitted by the Administration of the flag State if satisfied that the arrangements give protection equivalent to that afforded by a double bottom complying with this regulation. .4 A double bottom need not be fitted in way of watertight compartments of moderate size used exclusively for the carriage of liquids, provided the safety of the ship, in the event of bottom or side damage, is not, in the opinion of the Administration of the flag State, thereby impaired. .5 Notwithstanding paragraph .1 of this Regulation 10, the Administration of the flag State may permit a double bottom to be dispensed with in any part of the ship which is subdivided by a factor not exceeding 0,5, if satisfied that the fitting of a double bottom in that part would not be compatible with the design and proper working of the ship. 11 Assigning, marking and recording of subdivision load lines R 13 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .1 In order that the required degree of subdivision shall be maintained, a load line corresponding to the approved subdivision draught shall be assigned and marked on the ship s sides amidships. A ship having spaces which are specially adapted for the accommodation of passengers and the carriage of cargo alternatively may, if owners desire, have one or more additional load lines assigned and marked to correspond with the subdivision draughts which the Administration of the flag State may approve for alternative service conditions. EN 25.6.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 163 27  .2 The subdivision load lines assigned and marked shall be recorded in the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate, and shall be identified by the notation C.1 if there is only one subdivision load line. If there is more than one subdivision load line, the alternative conditions shall be identified by the notations C.2, C.3, C.4 etc. 1 . .3 The freeboard corresponding to each of these load lines shall be measured at the same position and from the same deck line as the freeboards determined in accordance with the International Convention on Load Lines in force. .4 The freeboard corresponding to each approved subdivision load line and the conditions of service for which it is approved shall be clearly indicated on the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate. .5 In no case shall any subdivision load line mark be placed above the deepest load line in salt water as determined by the strength of the ship or the International Convention on Load Lines in force. .6 Whatever may be the position of the subdivision load line marks, a ship shall in no case be loaded so as to submerge the load line mark appropriate to the season and locality as determined in accordance with the International Convention on Load Lines in force. .7 A ship shall in no case be so loaded that the subdivision load line mark appropriate to the particular voyage and condition of service is submerged. 12 Construction and initial testing of watertight bulkheads, etc. R 14 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .1 Each watertight subdivision bulkhead, whether transverse or longitudinal, shall be constructed in such a manner that it shall be capable of supporting, with a proper margin of resistance, the pressure due to the maximum head of water which it might have to sustain in the event of damage to the ship but at least the pressure due to a head of water up to the margin line. The construction of these bulkheads shall be in accordance with the standards of a recognised organisation. .2.1 Steps and recesses in bulkheads shall be watertight and as strong as the bulkhead at the place where each occurs. .2.2 Where frames or beams pass through a watertight deck or bulkhead, such deck or bulkhead shall be made structurally watertight without the use of wood or cement. .3 Testing main compartments by filling them with water is not compulsory. When testing by filling with water is not carried out, a hose test shall be carried out where practicable. This test shall be carried out in the most advanced stage of the fitting out of the ship. Where a hose test is not practicable because of possible damage to machinery, electrical equipment insulation or out fitting items, it may be replaced by a careful visual examination of welded connections, supported where deemed necessary by means such as a dye penetrant test or ultrasonic leak test or an equivalent test. In any case, a thorough inspection of the watertight bulkheads shall be carried out. .4 The forepeak, double bottoms including duct keels and inner skins shall be tested with water to a head corresponding to the requirements of paragraph .1 of this Regulation 12. .5 Tanks which are intended to hold liquids, and which form part of the subdivision of the ship, shall be tested for tightness with water to a head up to the deepest subdivision load line or to a head corresponding to two thirds of the depth from the top of keel to the margin line in way of the tanks, whichever is the greater, provided that in no case shall the test head be less than 0,9 metres above the top of the tank if testing by water is impracticable, air leak testing while the tanks are subjected to an air pressure of not more than 0,14 bar may be accepted. .6 The tests referred to in paragraphs .4 and .5 are for the purpose of ensuring that the subdivision structural arrangements are watertight and are not to be regarded as a test of the fitness of any compartment for the storage of oil fuel or for other special purposes for which a test of a superior character may be required depending on the height to which the liquid has access in the tank or its connections. EN L 163 28 Official Journal of the European Union 25.6.2009 1 The arabic numerals following the letter C in the subdivision load line notations may be replaced by roman numerals or letters if the Administration of the flag State considers this necessary to make the distinction with the international subdivision load line notations.  13 Openings in watertight bulkheads R 15 NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .1 The number of openings in watertight bulkheads shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship satisfactory means shall be provided for closing these openings. .2.1 Where pipes, scuppers, electrical cables, etc., are carried through watertight subdivision bulkheads, arrangements shall be made to ensure the watertight integrity of the bulkheads. .2.2 Valves not forming part of a piping system shall not be permitted in watertight subdivision bulkheads. .2.3 Lead or other heat sensitive materials shall not be used in systems which penetrate watertight subdivision bulkheads, where deterioration of such systems in the event of fire would impair the watertight integrity of the bulkheads. .3.1 No doors, manholes, or access openings are permitted .1 in the collision bulkhead below the margin line .2 in watertight transverse bulkheads dividing a cargo space from an adjoining cargo space, except as provided for in paragraph .10.1 of this Regulation 13 and in Regulation 14. .3.2 Except as provided in paragraph .3.3, the collision bulkhead may be pierced below the margin line by no more than one pipe for dealing with fluid in the fore peak tank, provided that the pipe is fitted with a screw down valve capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck, the valve chest being secured inside the fore peak to the collision bulkhead. However, the fitting of this valve on the afterside of the collision bulkhead may be accepted provided that the valve is readily accessible under all service conditions and the space in which it is located is not a cargo space. .3.3 If the fore peak is divided to hold two different kinds of liquids, the collision bulkhead may be pierced below the margin line by two pipes each of which is fitted as required by paragraph .3.1, provided that there is no practical alternative to the fitting of such a second pipe and that, having regard to the additional subdivision provided in the forepeak, the safety of the ship is maintained. .4 Within spaces containing the main and auxiliary propulsion machinery including boilers serving the needs of propulsion not more than one door apart from the doors to shaft tunnels may be fitted in each main transverse bulkhead. Where two or more shafts are fitted the tunnels shall be connected by an intercom municating passage. There shall be only one door between the machinery space and the tunnel spaces where two shafts are fitted and only two doors where there are more than two shafts. All these doors shall be of the sliding type and shall be so located as to have their sills as high as practicable. The hand gear for operating these doors from above the bulkhead deck shall be situated outside the spaces containing the machinery. .5.1 EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS AND NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS OF LESS THAN 24 METRES IN LENGTH Watertight doors shall be sliding doors or hinged doors or doors of an equivalent type. Plate doors secured only by bolts and doors required to be closed by dropping or by the action of a dropping weight are not permitted. NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS OF 24 METRES IN LENGTH AND OVER Watertight doors, except as provided in paragraph .10.1 of this Regulation 13 or Regulation 14, shall be power operated sliding doors complying with the requirements of paragraph .7 capable of being closed simultaneously from the central operating console at the navigating bridge in not more than 60 seconds with the ship in upright position. .5.2 EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS AND NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS OF LESS THAN 24 METRES IN LENGTH Sliding doors may be either hand operated only or power operated as well as hand operated. EN 25.6.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 163 29  NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS OF 24 METRES IN LENGTH AND OVER In ships where the total number of watertight doors is not more than two and these doors are situated in the machinery space or in the bulkheads bounding such space, the Administration of the flag State may allow these two doors to be hand operated only. Where hand operated sliding doors are fitted, such doors are to be closed before the vessel leaves its berth on a passenger carrying voyage and shall be kept closed during navigation. NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .5.3 The means of operation whether by power or by hand of any sliding watertight door whether power operated or not shall be capable of closing the door with the ship listed to 15 either way. Consideration shall also be given to the forces which may act on either side of the doors as may be experienced when water is flowing through the opening applying a static head equivalent to a water height of at least 1 metre above the sill on the centreline of the door. NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS OF 24 METRES IN LENGTH AND OVER .5.4 Watertight door controls, including hydraulic piping and electric cables, shall be kept as close as practicable to the bulkhead in which the doors are fitted, in order to minimise the likelihood of them being involved in any damage which the ship may sustain. The positioning of watertight doors and their controls shall be such that if the ship sustains damage within one fifth of the breadth of the ship, such distance being measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line, the operation of the watertight doors clear of the damaged portion of the ship is not impaired. .5.5 All power operated and hand operated sliding watertight doors shall be provided with means of indication which will show at all remote operating positions whether the doors are open or closed. Remote operating positions shall only be at the navigating bridge as required by paragraph .7.1.5 and the location where hand operation above the bulkhead deck is required by paragraph .7.1.4. EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS AND NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS OF LESS THAN 24 METRES IN LENGTH .5.6 Watertight doors which do not comply with paragraphs .5.1 to .5.5 shall be closed before the voyage commences, and shall be kept closed during navigation the time of opening such doors in port and of closing them before the ship leaves port shall be entered in the logbook. NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS OF LESS THAN 24 METRES IN LENGTH AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .6.1 Hand operated sliding doors may have a horizontal or vertical motion. It shall be possible to operate the mechanism at the door itself from either side, and from an accessible position above the bulkhead deck, with an all round crank motion, or some other movement providing the same guarantee of safety and of an approved type. When operating a hand gear the time necessary for the complete closure of the door with the vessel upright shall not exceed 90 seconds. EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .6.2 Power operated sliding doors may have a vertical or horizontal motion. If a door is power operated from a central control, the gearing shall be so arranged that the door can also be operated by power at the door itself from both sides. Local control handles in connection with the power gear shall be provided on each side of the bulkhead and shall be so arranged as to enable persons passing through the doorway to hold both handles in the open position without being able to set the closing mechanism in operation accidentally. Power operated sliding doors shall be provided with hand gear workable at the door itself on either side and from an accessible position above the bulkhead deck, with an all round crank motion or some other movement providing the same guarantee of safety and of an approved type. Provision shall be made to give warnings by sound signal that the door has begun to close and will continue to sound until it is completely closed. Additionally, in areas of high ambient noise an audible alarm shall be required to be supplemented by an intermittent visual signal at the door. NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS OF 24 METRES IN LENGTH AND OVER .7.1 Each power operated sliding watertight door .1 shall have a vertical or horizontal motion .2 shall, subject to paragraph .11, be normally limited to a maximum clear width of 1,2 metres. The Administration of the flag State may permit larger doors only to the extent considered necessary for the effective operation of the ship provided that other safety measures, including the following, are taken into consideration EN L 163 30 Official Journal of the European Union 25.6.2009  .2.1 special consideration shall be given to the strength of the door and its closing appliances in order to prevent leakages .2.2 the door shall be located outside the damage zone B 5 .2.3 the door shall be kept closed when the ship is at sea, except for limited periods when absolutely necessary as determined by the Administration of the flag State .3 shall be fitted with the necessary equipment to open and close the door using electric power, hydraulic power, or any other form of power that is acceptable to the Administration of the flag State .4 shall be provided with an individual hand operated mechanism. It shall be possible to open and close the door by hand at the door itself from either side, and in addition, close the door from an accessible position above the bulkhead deck with an all round crank motion or some other movement providing the same degree of safety acceptable to the Administration of the flag State. Direction of rotation or other movement is to be clearly indicated on all operating positions. The time necessary for the complete closure of the door, when operated by hand gear, shall not exceed 90 seconds with the ship in upright position .5 shall be provided with controls for opening and closing the door by power from both sides of the door and also for closing the door by power from the central operating console at the navigating bridge .6 shall be provided with an audible alarm, distinct from any other alarm in the area, which will sound whenever the door is closed remotely by power and which shall sound for at least 5 seconds but no more than 10 seconds before the door begins to move and shall continue sounding until the door is completely closed. In the case of remote hand operation it is sufficient for the audible alarm to sound only when the door is moving. Additionally, in passenger areas and areas of high ambient noise, the Administration of the flag State may require the audible alarm to be supplemented by an intermittent visual signal at the door and .7 shall have an approximately uniform rate of closure under power. The closure time, from the time the door begins to move to the time it reaches the completely closed position, shall in no case be less than 20 seconds and no more than 40 seconds with the ship in upright position. .7.2 The electrical power required for power operated sliding watertight doors shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck the associated control, indication and alarm circuits shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck and be capable of being automatically supplied by the transitional source of emergency electrical power in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power. .7.3 Power operated sliding watertight doors shall have either .1 a centralised hydraulic system with two independent power sources each consisting of a motor and pump capable of simultaneously closing all doors. In addition, there shall be for the whole installation hydraulic accumulators of sufficient capacity to operate all the doors at least three times, i. e. closed open closed, against an adverse list of 15 . This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulator is at the pump cut in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperature liable to be encountered by the installation during its service.

For the purpose of applying the definition of steel or other equivalent material as given in Regulation II 2 A 2.7, the applicable fire exposure shall be according to the integrity and insulation standards given in the tables of Regulations 4 and 5. For example, where divisions such as decks or sides and ends of deckhouses are permitted to have B 0 fire integrity, the applicable fire exposure shall be half an hour. .2 However, in cases where any part of the structure is of aluminium alloy, the following shall apply .1 The insulation of aluminium alloy components of A or B class divisions, except structure which is non load bearing, shall be such that the temperature of the structural core does not rise more than 200 C above the ambient temperature at any time during the applicable fire exposure to the standard fire test. .2 Special attention shall be given to the insulation of aluminium alloy components of columns, stanchions and other structural members required to support lifeboat and life raft stowage, launching and embarkation areas, and A and B class divisions to ensure .1 that for such members supporting lifeboat and life raft areas and A class divisions, the temperature rise limitation specified in paragraph .2.1 shall apply at the end of one hour and .2 that for such members required to support B class divisions, the temperature rise limitation specified in paragraph .2.1 shall apply at the end of half an hour. .3 Crowns and casings of machinery spaces shall be of steel construction adequately insulated and openings therein, if any, shall be suitably arranged and protected to prevent the spread of fire. 2 Main vertical zones and horizontal zones R 24 NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS .1.1 In ships carrying more than 36 passengers, the hull, superstructure and deckhouses shall be subdivided into main vertical zones by A 60 class divisions. Steps and recesses shall be kept to a minimum but where they are necessary, they shall also be A 60 class divisions. Where an open deck space, a sanitary or similar space or a tank including a fuel oil tank, void space or auxiliary machinery space having little or no fire risk, is on one side or where fuel oil tanks are on both sides of the division the standard may be reduced to A 0. NEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS .1.2 For new class B, C and D ships carrying not more than 36 passengers and for existing class B ships carrying more than 36 passengers, the hull, superstructure and deckhouses in way of accommodation and service spaces shall be subdivided into main vertical zones by A class divisions. These divisions shall have insulation values in accordance with the tables in Regulation 5. NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS .2 As far as practicable, the bulkheads forming the boundaries of the main vertical zones above the bulkhead deck shall be in line with watertight subdivision bulkheads situated immediately below the bulkhead deck. The length and width of main vertical zones may be extended to a maximum of 48 metres in order to bring the ends of main vertical zones to coincide with subdivision watertight bulkheads or in order to accommodate a large public space extending for the whole length of the main vertical zone provided that the total area of the main vertical zone is not greater than 1 600 m 2 on any deck. The length or width of a main vertical zone is the maximum distance between the furthermost points of the bulkheads bounding it.
