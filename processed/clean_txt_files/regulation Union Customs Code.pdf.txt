I Legislative acts REGULATIONS REGULATION EU No 952 2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code recast THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 33, 114 and 207 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 2 , Whereas 1 A number of amendments are to be made to Regulation EC No 450 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code Modernised Customs Code 3 . In the interests of clarity, that Regulation should be recast. 2 It is appropriate to ensure that Regulation EC No 450 2008 is consistent with the Treaty on the Func tioning of the European Union TFEU , in particular Articles 290 and 291 thereof. It is also appropriate that the Regulation take account of the evolution of Union law and that some of its provisions are adapted in order to facilitate their application. 3 In order to supplement or amend certain non essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. 4 In particular, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, the Commission should ensure that Member States experts and the business community are consulted in a transparent manner, and well in advance. 5 In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implemen tation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in order to specify the format and code of the common data requirements for the purpose of the exchange of information between the customs authorities and between economic operators and customs authorities and the storage of such information and the procedural rules on the exchange and storage of information which can be made by means other than electronic data processing techniques to adopt decisions allowing one or several Member States to use means for the exchange and storage of information other than elec tronic data processing techniques to specify the customs authority which is responsible for the registration of economic operators

notification to adopt a work programme supporting the development of related elec tronic systems and governing the setting up of transi tional periods to adopt decisions authorising Member States to test simplifications in the application of the customs legislation, especially when those simplifications are information technology IT related. Those powers EN L 269 2 Official Journal of the European Union 10.10.2013  should be exercised in accordance with Regulation EU No 182 2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission s exercise of implementing powers 1 . 6 Considering the cooperation which is needed between the Member States and the Commission to develop, maintain and employ the electronic systems required for the implementation of the Union Customs Code the Code , the Commission should not adopt the work programme supporting that development and governing the setting up of transitional periods where no opinion is delivered by the committee examining the draft imple menting act. 7 The advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of decisions allowing one or several Member States to use means for the exchange and storage of information other than electronic data processing techniques, given that those decisions do not affect all Member States decisions requesting Member States to revoke decisions relating to binding information, given that those decisions affect only one Member State and aim at ensuring compliance with the customs legislation decisions on repayment or remission of an amount of import or export duty given that those decisions directly affect the applicant for that repayment or remission. 8 In duly justified cases, where imperative grounds of urgency so require, the Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts relating to measures to ensure uniform application of customs controls, including the exchange of risk information and analysis, common risk criteria and standards, control measures and priority control areas the deter mination of the tariff classification of goods the deter mination of the origin of specific goods measures temporarily prohibiting the use of comprehensive guar antees. 9 The Union is based upon a customs union. It is advisable, in the interests both of economic operators and of the customs authorities in the Union, to assemble current customs legislation in a code. Based on the concept of an internal market, that code should contain the general rules and procedures which ensure the implementation of the tariff and other common policy measures introduced at Union level in connection with trade in goods between the Union and countries or territories outside the customs territory of the Union, taking into account the requirements of those common policies. Customs legislation should be better aligned on the provisions relating to the collection of import charges without change to the scope of the tax provisions in force. 10 In order to ensure effective administrative simplification, the views of economic operators should be taken into account when the customs legislation is further modernised. 11 In accordance with the Commission Communication of 9 August 2004 entitled Protecting the Communities financial interests Fight against fraud Action Plan for 2004 2005 , it is appropriate to adapt the legal framework for the protection of the financial interests of the Union. 12 Council Regulation EEC No 2913 92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code 2 was based upon integration of the customs procedures applied separately in the respective Member States during the 1980s. That Regulation has been repeatedly and substantially amended since its introduction, in order to address specific problems such as the protection of good faith or the taking into account of security requirements. Further amendments to that Regulation were introduced by Regulation EC No 648 2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 April 2005 3 and subsequently included in Regulation EC No 450 2008 as a consequence of the important legal changes which have occurred in recent years, at both Union and international level, such as the expiry of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and the entry into force of the 2003, 2005 and 2011 Acts of Accession, as well as the amendment to the International Convention on the simplification and harmonisation of customs procedures the Revised Kyoto Convention , the Union s accession to which was approved by Council Decision 2003 231 EC of 17 March 2003 4 . 13 It is appropriate to introduce in the Code a legal framework for the application of certain provisions of the customs legislation to trade in Union goods between parts of the customs territory to which the provisions of Council Directive 2006 112 EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax 5 or Council Directive 2008 118 EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty 6 apply and parts of that territory where those provisions do not apply, or to trade between parts where those provisions do not apply. Considering the fact that the goods concerned are Union goods and considering the fiscal nature of the measures at stake in that intra Union trade, it is justified to introduce, appropriate simplifications to the customs formalities to be applied to those goods. EN 10.10.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 269 3 1 OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13. 2 OJ L 302, 19.10.1992, p. 1. 3 OJ L 117, 4.5.2005, p. 13. 4 OJ L 86, 3.4.2003, p. 21. 5 OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1. 6 OJ L 9, 14.1.2009, p. 12.   14 In order to take into account the special fiscal regime of certain parts of the customs territory of the Union, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the customs formalities and controls to be applied to the trade in Union goods between those parts and the rest of the customs territory of the Union. 15 The facilitation of legitimate trade and the fight against fraud require simple, rapid and standard customs procedures and processes. It is therefore appropriate, in line with the Commission Communication of 24 July 2003 entitled A simple and paperless environment for customs and trade , to simplify customs legislation, to allow the use of modern tools and technology and to promote further the uniform application of customs legislation and modernised approaches to customs control, thus helping to ensure the basis for efficient and simple clearance procedures. Customs procedures should be merged or aligned and the number of procedures reduced to those that are economically justified, with a view to increasing the competitiveness of business. 16 The completion of the internal market, the reduction of barriers to international trade and investment and the reinforced need to ensure security and safety at the external borders of the Union have transformed the role of customs authorities giving them a leading role within the supply chain and, in their monitoring and management of international trade, making them a catalyst to the competitiveness of countries and companies. The customs legislation should therefore reflect the new economic reality and the new role and mission of customs authorities. 17 The use of information and communication technologies, as laid down in Decision No 70 2008 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on a paperless environment for customs and trade 1 , is a key element in ensuring trade facilitation and, at the same time, the effectiveness of customs controls, thus reducing costs for business and risk for society. It is therefore necessary to establish in the Code the legal framework within which that Decision can be implemented, in particular the legal principle that all customs and trade transactions are to be handled electronically and that information and communication systems for customs operations are to offer, in each Member State, the same facilities to economic operators. 18 In order to ensure a paperless environment for customs and trade, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of common data requirements for the purpose of the exchange and storage of information using electronic data processing techniques, cases where other means may be used for such exchange and storage and registration of persons. Means other than electronic data processing techniques could be used in particular on a transitional basis, where the necessary electronic systems are not yet operational, but not beyond 31 December 2020. Insofar as centralised clearance is concerned, those transitional measures would consist, until the necessary electronic systems are operational, in maintaining the procedure currently known as the single authorisation for simplified procedures . 19 Use of information and communication technologies should be accompanied by harmonised and standardised application of customs controls by the Member States, to ensure an equivalent level of customs control throughout the Union so as not to give rise to anti competitive behaviour at the various Union entry and exit points. 20 In the interests of facilitating business, while at the same time providing for the proper levels of control of goods brought into or taken out of the customs territory of the Union, it is desirable that the information provided by economic operators be shared, taking account of the relevant data protection provisions, between customs authorities and with other agencies involved in that control. Those controls should be harmonised, so that the economic operator need give the information only once and that goods are controlled by those authorities at the same time and at the same place. 21 In the interests of facilitating business, all persons should continue to have the right to appoint a representative in their dealings with the customs authorities. However, it should no longer be possible for that right of represen tation to be reserved under a law laid down by one of the Member States. Furthermore, a customs represen tative who complies with the criteria for the granting of the status of authorised economic operator for customs simplifications should be entitled to provide his or her services in a Member State other than the Member State where he or she is established. As a general rule, a customs representative should be estab lished in the customs territory of the Union. That obligation should be waived where the customs represen tative acts on behalf of persons who are not required to be established within the customs territory of the Union or in other justified cases. 22 All decisions relating to the application of the customs legislation, including to binding information, should be covered by the same rules. Any such decisions should be valid throughout the Union and should be capable of being annulled, amended except where otherwise stipu lated, or revoked where they do not conform to the customs legislation or its interpretation. EN L 269 4 Official Journal of the European Union 10.10.2013 1 OJ L 23, 26.1.2008, p. 21.   23 The streamlining of customs procedures within an elec tronic environment requires the sharing of responsi bilities between the customs authorities of different Member States. It is necessary to ensure an appropriate level of effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties throughout the internal market. 24 Compliant and trustworthy economic operators should enjoy the status of authorised economic operator subject to the granting of an authorisation for customs simplifications or an authorisation for security and safety, or both. Depending on the type of authorisation granted, authorised economic operators should be able to take maximum advantage of widespread use of customs simplifications or benefit from facilitations relating to security and safety. They should also be given more favourable treatment in respect of customs controls, such as fewer physical and document based controls. 25 Compliant and trustworthy economic operators should benefit from international mutual recognition of the status of authorised economic operator . 26 In order to secure a balance between, on the one hand, the need for customs authorities to ensure the correct application of the customs legislation and, on the other, the right of economic operators to be treated fairly, the customs authorities should be granted extensive powers of control and economic operators a right of appeal. 27 In accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, it is necessary, in addition to the right of appeal against any decision taken by the customs authorities, to provide for the right of every person to be heard before any decision is taken which would adversely affect him or her. However, restrictions to that right may be justified in particular where the nature or the level of the threat to the security and safety of the Union and its residents, to human, animal or plant health, to the environment or to consumers so requires. 28 In order to minimise the risk to the Union, its citizens and its trading partners, the harmonised application of customs controls by the Member States should be based upon a common risk management framework and an electronic system for its implementation. The estab lishment of a risk management framework common to all Member States should not prevent them from controlling goods by random checks. 29 In order to ensure a consistent and equal treatment of persons concerned by customs formalities and controls, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of determining other cases where the customs representative is not obliged to be established in the customs territory of the Union and rules relating to decisions taken by the customs auth orities, including those relating to binding information, authorised economic operator and simplifications. 30 It is necessary to establish the factors on the basis of which import or export duty and other measures in respect of trade in goods are applied. It is also appro priate to lay down more detailed provisions for issuing proofs of origin in the Union, where the exigencies of trade so require. 31 In order to supplement the factors on the basis of which import or export duty and other measures are applied, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of rules on origin of goods. 32 It is desirable to group together all cases of incurrence of a customs debt on import, other than following the submission of a customs declaration for release for free circulation or temporary admission with partial relief, in order to avoid difficulties in determining the legal basis on which the customs debt was incurred. The same should apply in cases of incurrence of a customs debt on export. 33 It is appropriate to establish the place where the customs debt is incurred and where the import or export duty should be recovered. 34 The rules for special procedures should allow for the use of a single guarantee for all categories of special procedures and for that guarantee to be comprehensive, covering a number of transactions. 35 A comprehensive guarantee with a reduced amount, including for customs debts and other charges which have been incurred, or a comprehensive guarantee with a guarantee waiver, should be authorised under certain conditions. A comprehensive guarantee with a reduced amount for customs debts and other charges which have been incurred should be equivalent to the provision of a guarantee for the whole amount of import or export duty payable, in particular for the purposes of the release of the goods concerned and of the entry in the accounts. EN 10.10.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 269 5   36 In order to ensure better protection of the financial interests of the Union and of the Member States, a guarantee should cover non declared or incorrectly declared goods included in a consignment or in a declaration for which it is provided. For the same reason, the undertaking of the guarantor should also cover amounts of import or export duty which fall to be paid following post release controls. 37 In order to safeguard the financial interests of the Union and of the Member States and to curb fraudulent prac tices, arrangements involving graduated measures for the application of a comprehensive guarantee are advisable. Where there is an increased risk of fraud it should be possible to prohibit temporarily the application of the comprehensive guarantee, taking account of the particular situation of the economic operators concerned. 38 It is appropriate to take account of the good faith of the person concerned in cases where a customs debt is incurred through non compliance with the customs legis lation and to minimise the impact of negligence on the part of the debtor. 39 In order to protect the financial interests of the Union and of the Member States and to supplement the rules concerning the customs debt and the guarantees, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the place of incurrence of the customs debt, the calculation of the amount of import and export duty, the guarantee of that amount and the recovery, repayment, remission and extin guishment of the customs debt. 40 It is necessary to lay down the principle of how to determine the customs status of Union goods and the circumstances pertaining to the loss of such status, and to provide a basis for determining when that status remains unaltered in cases where goods are temporarily taken out of the customs territory of the Union. 41 In order to ensure free movement of Union goods in the customs territory of the Union and customs treatment of non Union goods brought into that territory, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the determination of the customs status of goods, the loss of the customs status of Union goods, the preser vation of that status for goods temporarily leaving the customs territory of the Union and the duty relief for returned goods. 42 It is appropriate, where an economic operator has provided, in advance, the information necessary for risk based controls on the admissibility of the goods, to ensure that quick release of goods is then the rule. Fiscal and trade policy controls should primarily be performed by the customs office competent in respect of the premises of the economic operator. 43 The rules for customs declarations and for the placing of goods under a customs procedure should be modernised and streamlined, in particular by requiring that, as a rule, customs declarations be made electronically and by providing for only one type of simplified declaration and for the possibility to lodge a customs declaration in the form of an entry in the declarant s records. 44 Since the Revised Kyoto Convention favours the lodging, registering and checking of the customs declaration prior to the arrival of the goods and, furthermore, the disso ciation of the place where the declaration is lodged from the place where the goods are physically located, it is appropriate to provide for centralised clearance at the place where the economic operator is established. 45 It is appropriate to lay down at Union level the rules governing the destruction or disposal otherwise of goods by the customs authorities, since these are matters which previously required national legislation. 46 In order to supplement the rules regarding the placing of goods under a customs procedure and ensure equal treatment of the persons concerned, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the rules relating to the customs declaration and the release of goods. 47 It is appropriate to lay down common and simple rules for the special procedures, supplemented by a small set of rules for each category of special procedure, in order to make it simple for the operator to choose the right procedure, to avoid errors and to reduce the number of post release recoveries and repayments. 48 The granting of authorisations for several special procedures with a single guarantee and a single super vising customs office should be facilitated and there should be simple rules on the incurrence of a customs debt in these cases. The basic principle should be that goods placed under a special procedure, or the products made from them, are to be assessed at the time when the customs debt is incurred. However, it should also be possible, where economically justified, to assess the goods at the time when they were placed under a special procedure. The same principles should apply to usual forms of handling. EN L 269 6 Official Journal of the European Union 10.10.2013   49 In view of increased security related measures, the placing of goods into free zones should become a customs procedure and the goods should be subject to customs controls at entry and with regard to records. 50 Given that the intention of re export is no longer necessary, the inward processing suspension procedure should be merged with processing under customs control and the inward processing drawback procedure abandoned. This single inward processing procedure should also cover destruction, except where destruction is carried out by, or under the supervision of, customs. 51 In order to supplement the rules on special procedures and ensure equal treatment of the persons concerned, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the rules relating to cases where goods are placed under special procedures, move ments, usual forms of handling and equivalence of those goods and discharge of those procedures. 52 Security related measures relating to Union goods taken out of the customs territory of the Union should apply equally to the re export of non Union goods. The same rules should apply to all types of goods, with the possi bility of exceptions where necessary, such as for goods only transiting through the customs territory of the Union. 53 In order to ensure the customs supervision of goods brought into and taken out of the customs territory of the Union and the application of security related measures, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the rules relating to entry summary declaration and pre departure declar ations. 54 In order to explore further customs and trade facilitation, in particular by making use of the most recent tools and technology, Member States should be authorised, under certain conditions and upon application, to test for a limited period of time simplifications in the application of the customs legislation. That possibility should not jeopardise the application of the customs legislation or create new obligations for economic operators, who may take part in these tests on a purely voluntary basis. 55 In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union TEU , it is necessary and appropriate, for the achievement of the basic objectives of enabling the customs union to function effectively and implementing the common commercial policy, to lay down the general rules and procedures applicable to goods brought into or taken out of the customs territory of the Union. In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 5 4 TEU, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. 56 In order to simplify and rationalise customs legislation, a number of provisions contained in autonomous Union acts have, for the sake of transparency, been incorporated into the Code. Council Regulation EEC No 3925 91 of 19 December 1991 concerning the elimination of controls and formalities applicable to the cabin and hold baggage of persons taking an intra Community flight and the baggage of persons making an intra Community sea crossing 1 , Regulation EEC No 2913 92, Council Regulation EC No 1207 2001 of 11 June 2001 on procedures to facilitate the issue or the making out in the Community of proofs of origin and the issue of certain approved exporter authorisations under the provisions governing preferential trade between the European Community and certain coun tries 2 , and Regulation EC No 450 2008 should therefore be repealed. 57 The provisions of this Regulation setting out the delegation of power and the conferral of implementing powers and the provisions on charges and costs should apply from the date of entry into force of this Regu lation. The other provisions should apply from 1 June 2016. 58 This Regulation should be without prejudice to existing and future Union rules on access to documents adopted in accordance with Article 15 3 TFEU. It should also be without prejudice to national rules on access to docu ments. 59 The Commission should make every effort to ensure that the delegated and implementing acts provided for in this Regulation enter into force sufficiently in advance of the application date of the Code to allow its timely imple mentation by Member States, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION EN 10.10.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 269 7 1 OJ L 374, 31.12.1991, p. 4. 2 OJ L 165, 21.6.2001, p. 1.

Customs controls, other than random checks, shall primarily be based on risk analysis using electronic data processing techniques, with the purpose of identifying and evaluating the risks and developing the necessary counter measures, on the basis of criteria developed at national, Union and, where available, international level. 3. Customs controls shall be performed within a common risk management framework, based upon the exchange of risk information and risk analysis results between customs adminis trations and establishing common risk criteria and standards, control measures and priority control areas. Controls based upon such information and criteria shall be carried out without prejudice to other controls carried out in accordance with paragraph 1 or with other provisions in force. EN L 269 26 Official Journal of the European Union 10.10.2013  4. Customs authorities shall undertake risk management to differentiate between the levels of risk associated with goods subject to customs control or supervision and to determine whether the goods will be subject to specific customs controls, and if so, where. The risk management shall include activities such as collecting data and information, analysing and assessing risk, prescribing and taking action and regularly monitoring and reviewing that process and its outcomes, based on international, Union and national sources and strategies. 5. Customs authorities shall exchange risk information and risk analysis results where a the risks are assessed by a customs authority as being significant and requiring customs control and the results of the control establish that the event triggering the risks has occurred or b the control results do not establish that the event triggering the risks has occurred, but the customs authority concerned considers the threat to present a high risk elsewhere in the Union. 6. For the establishment of the common risk criteria and standards, the control measures and the priority control areas referred to in paragraph 3, account shall be taken of all of the following a the proportionality to the risk b the urgency of the necessary application of the controls c the probable impact on trade flow, on individual Member States and on control resources. 7. The common risk criteria and standards referred to in paragraph 3 shall include all of the following a a description of the risks b the factors or indicators of risk to be used to select goods or economic operators for customs control c the nature of customs controls to be undertaken by the customs authorities d the duration of the application of the customs controls referred to in point c . 8. Priority control areas shall cover particular customs procedures, types of goods, traffic routes, modes of transport or economic operators which are subject to increased levels of risk analysis and customs controls during a certain period, without prejudice to other controls usually carried out by the customs authorities. Article 47 Cooperation between authorities 1. Where, in respect of the same goods, controls other than customs controls are to be performed by competent authorities other than the customs authorities, customs authorities shall, in close cooperation with those other authorities, endeavour to have those controls performed, wherever possible, at the same time and place as customs controls one stop shop , with customs authorities having the coordinating role in achieving this. 2. In the framework of the controls referred to in this Section, customs and other competent authorities may, where necessary for the purposes of minimising risk and combating fraud, exchange with each other and with the Commission data received in the context of the entry, exit, transit, movement, storage and end use of goods, including postal traffic, moved between the customs territory of the Union and countries or territories outside the customs territory of the Union, the presence and movement within the customs territory of the Union of non Union goods and goods placed under the end use procedure, and the results of any control. Customs auth orities and the Commission may also exchange such data with each other for the purpose of ensuring a uniform application of the customs legislation. Article 48 Post release control For the purpose of customs controls, the customs authorities may verify the accuracy and completeness of the information given in a customs declaration, temporary storage declaration, entry summary declaration, exit summary declaration, re export declaration or re export notification, and the existence, auth enticity, accuracy and validity of any supporting document and may examine the accounts of the declarant and other records relating to the operations in respect of the goods in question or to prior or subsequent commercial operations involving those goods after having released them. Those auth orities may also examine such goods and or take samples where it is still possible for them to do so. Such controls may be carried out at the premises of the holder of the goods or of the holder s representative, of any other person directly or indirectly involved in those operations in a business capacity or of any other person in possession of those documents and data for business purposes. EN 10.10.2013 Official Journal of the European Union L 269 27  Article 49 Intra Union flights and sea crossings 1.

CHAPTER 3 Currency conversion and time limits Article 53 Currency conversion 1. The competent authorities shall publish and or make available on the Internet the rate of exchange applicable where the conversion of currency is necessary for one of the following reasons a because factors used to determine the customs value of goods are expressed in a currency other than that of the Member State where the customs value is determined b because the value of the euro is required in national currencies for the purposes of determining the tariff classifi cation of goods and the amount of import and export duty, including value thresholds in the Common Customs Tariff. 2. Where the conversion of currency is necessary for reasons other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the value of the euro in national currencies to be applied within the framework of the customs legislation shall be fixed at least once a year.

In such cases, the interest shall be paid from the date of expiry of the three month period until the date of repayment. The rate of interest shall be established in accordance with Article 112. 7. Where the customs authorities have granted repayment or remission in error, the original customs debt shall be reinstated insofar as it is not time barred under Article 103.

Article 117 Overcharged amounts of import or export duty 1. An amount of import or export duty shall be repaid or remitted insofar as the amount corresponding to the customs debt initially notified exceeds the amount payable, or the customs debt was notified to the debtor contrary to points c or d of Article 102 1 . 2. Where the application for repayment or remission is based on the existence, at the time when the declaration for release for free circulation was accepted, of a reduced or zero rate of import duty on the goods under a tariff quota, a tariff ceiling or other favourable tariff measures, repayment or remission shall be granted provided that, at the time of lodging the application accompanied by the necessary docu ments, either of the following conditions are fulfilled a in the case of a tariff quota, its volume has not been exhausted b in other cases, the rate of duty normally due has not been re established.

Where the conditions laid down in Article 117 2 are not fulfilled, repayment or remission shall be granted where failure to apply the reduced or zero rate of duty was as a result of an error on the part of the customs authorities and the customs declaration for release for free circulation contained all the particulars and was accompanied by all the documents necessary for application of the reduced or zero rate. 3. Where the preferential treatment of the goods is granted on the basis of a system of administrative cooperation involving the authorities of a country or territory outside the customs territory of the Union, the issue of a certificate by those auth orities, should it prove to be incorrect, shall constitute an error which could not reasonably have been detected within the meaning of point a of paragraph 1. EN L 269 48 Official Journal of the European Union 10.10.2013  The issue of an incorrect certificate shall not, however, constitute an error where the certificate is based on an incorrect account of the facts provided by the exporter, except where it is evident that the issuing authorities were aware or should have been aware that the goods did not satisfy the conditions laid down for entitlement to the prefer ential treatment. The debtor shall be considered to be in good faith if he or she can demonstrate that, during the period of the trading oper ations concerned, he or she has taken due care to ensure that all the conditions for the preferential treatment have been fulfilled. The debtor may not rely on a plea of good faith if the Commission has published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union stating that there are grounds for doubt concerning the proper application of the preferential arrangements by the beneficiary country or territory.

The special circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 shall be deemed to exist where it is clear from the circumstances of the case that the debtor is in an exceptional situation as compared with other operators engaged in the same business, and that, in the absence of such circumstances, he or she would not have suffered disadvantage by the collection of the amount of import or export duty. Article 121 Procedure for repayment and remission 1.
