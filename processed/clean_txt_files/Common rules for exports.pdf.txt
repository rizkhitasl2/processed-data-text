I Acts adopted under the EC Treaty Euratom Treaty whose publication is obligatory REGULATIONS COUNCIL REGULATION EC No 1061 2009 of 19 October 2009 establishing common rules for exports codified version THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, Having regard to the instruments establishing common organi sation of agricultural markets and to the instruments concerning processed agricultural products adopted in pursuance of Article 308 of the Treaty, in particular the provisions of those instruments which allow for derogation from the general principles that quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect may be replaced solely by the measures provided for in those same instruments, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Whereas 1 Council Regulation EEC No 2603 69 of 20 December 1969 establishing common rules for exports 1 has been substantially amended several times 2 . In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified. 2 The common commercial policy should be based on uniform principles, inter alia, as regards exports. 3 Common rules should therefore be established for exports from the Community. 4 Exports are almost completely liberalised in all the Member States. It is therefore possible to accept as a Community principle that exports to third countries are not subject to any quantitative restriction, subject to the exceptions provided for in this Regulation and without prejudice to such measures as Member States may take in conformity with the Treaty. 5 The Commission should be informed if, as a result of unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that protective measures might be necessary. 6 It is essential that examination should take place at Community level, in particular on the basis of any such information and within an advisory committee, of export terms and conditions, of export trends, of the various aspects of the economic and commercial situation, and of the measures, if any, to be taken. 7 It may become apparent from this examination that the Community should exercise surveillance over certain exports, or that interim protective measures should be introduced as a safeguard against unforeseen practices. The need for rapid and effective action makes it justifiable for the Commission to be empowered to decide upon such measures, but without prejudice to the subsequent position of the Council, whose responsi bility it is to adopt a policy consistent with the interests of the Community. 8 Any protective measures necessitated by the interests of the Community should be adopted with due regard for existing international obligations. 9 It is desirable that Member States be empowered, in certain circumstances and provided that their actions are on an interim basis only, to take protective measures individually. 10 It is desirable that while such protective measures are in operation there should be an opportunity for consul tation for the purpose of examining the effects of the measures and of ascertaining whether the conditions for their application are still satisfied. EN 7.11.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 291 1 1 OJ L 324, 27.12.1969, p. 25. 2 See Annex II.   11 It is necessary to authorise Member States which are bound by international commitments setting up, in cases of actual or potential supply difficulties, a system for the allocation of oil products between contracting parties to comply with the resulting obligations vis à vis third countries, without prejudice to Community provisions adopted to the same end. This authorisation should apply until the adoption by the Council of appro priate measures pursuant to commitments entered into by the Community or all the Member States. 12 This Regulation should apply to all products, whether industrial or agricultural. Its operation should be comple mentary to that of the instruments establishing common organisation of agricultural markets, and to that of the special instruments adopted under Article 308 of the Treaty for processed agricultural products. Any overlap between the provisions of this Regulation and the provisions of these instruments, particularly the protective clauses thereof, must however be avoided, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION CHAPTER I BASIC PRINCIPLE Article 1 The exportation of products from the European Community to third countries shall be free, that is to say, they shall not be subject to any quantitative restriction, with the exception of those restrictions which are applied in conformity with the provisions of this Regulation. CHAPTER II COMMUNITY INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION PROCEDURE Article 2 If, as a result of any unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that protective measures within the meaning of Chapter III might be necessary, it shall so notify the Commission, which shall advise the other Member States.
